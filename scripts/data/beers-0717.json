Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it. Come by and visit, listen to some tunes, grab a pint, fill a growler, and join us on this adventure.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-12-12 17:31:01", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "oPxIne", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Sterling", "createDate": "2013-12-12 17:31:34", "streetAddress": "23600 Overland Drive", "postalCode": "20166", "extendedAddress": "#180", "website": "http://ocelotbrewing.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(703) 474-3050", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.9629988, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Virginia", "longitude": -77.4992517, "updateDate": "2016-03-22 17:54:38", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Ocelot", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:49:14", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_wfdHi6-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_wfdHi6-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_wfdHi6-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_wfdHi6-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_wfdHi6-icon.png"}, "id": "Qvbd2N", "name": "Ocelot Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.
