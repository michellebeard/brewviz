In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard.
