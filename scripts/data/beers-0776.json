For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars.
