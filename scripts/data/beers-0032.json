The challenge was to take our combined skills and create a brewpub that excels in providing tasty beers, inspired food, and excellent customer service.  After meeting in college, the group entered the work place to refine the skills required to create and operate a successful brewpub.  In January of 2010, with inspired council from family, Paul Coggins relocated to Georgia to focus the group on one purpose.  With the help of God, the group was charged to create the best dining experience for the community.  After many months of construction, permitting, setbacks, and discoveries; Toasted and Tapped opened its doors to the public on November 26th, 2010.

Apparently hats tasted, because it soon emerged that there should be more than just a hobby. Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-05-07 17:45:28", "locations": [{"website": "http://brewage.at/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "1060 Wien", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2016-05-07 17:50:12", "countryIsoCode": "AT", "longitude": 16.3434939, "hoursOfOperation": "Tue:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nWed:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nThu:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n", "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+43 1 9550935", "streetAddress": "Mittelgasse 4", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-05-07 17:50:12", "country": {"displayName": "Austria", "name": "AUSTRIA", "isoThree": "AUT", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 40, "isoCode": "AT"}, "latitude": 48.1939642, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "mMnrjZ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brew Age", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-05-07 18:30:52", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png"}, "id": "Y2gEyS", "name": "Brew Age"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.075", "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
