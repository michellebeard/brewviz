This brew's roots are in the strong porters of 19th Century England, which ultimately evolved into the stronger stouts of today. \r\nOur Imperial Porter derives its tremendous complexity from the use of 8 different malts. We blend these to achieve a balance of sweet, caramel, and coffee flavors. A judicious use of dark roasted malts adds another level of intriguing notes to the mix. Generously hopped with German and American hops our Imperial Porter comes to life as it is allowed to warm to the ideal drinking temperature of 58-60 degrees. \r\nA great brew to add warmth and cheer to any beer lover's winter.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Imperial Porter", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/RptzsT/upload_rTidkj-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/RptzsT/upload_rTidkj-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/RptzsT/upload_rTidkj-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 9, "name": "Other Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.072", "description": "A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast. Black to very deep ruby/garnet in color. Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "35", "categoryId": 9, "srmMax": "40", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "7.5", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:41:46", "fgMax": "1.022", "shortName": "Baltic Porter", "abvMax": "9", "id": 104, "srmMin": "40", "name": "Baltic-Style Porter"}, "id": "RptzsT", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:28", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 06:40:59", "abv": "7.85", "styleId": 104, "availableId": 1, "glasswareId": 5, "ibu": "70", "name": "Imperial Porter"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Bourbon Barrel Aged.
