Native of the Himalayas, it takes its name from the ancient Sanskrit devadaru, meaning timber of the gods. This coniferous evergreen, with its gracefully droopy branches and blue-green needles, has been a San Francisco favorite for over 150 years.\r\n\r\nThe annual search for the perfect tree for our Christmas Ale label usually takes us far afield.
