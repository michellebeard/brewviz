Not another new flavor of a mass-produced, foreign-owned beer, but something local that is new and exciting. That is why Chameleon Brewing is here.\r\n\r\nChameleon was founded by Randy Sprecher of Sprecher Brewing, a local company that Milwaukeeans have grown to know and love for 25 years. Just like Sprecher, Chameleon Brewing supports the local economy and recognizes that innovative American brewing styles are now setting the bar in the international beer world. Chameleon is a company focused on taking brewing to the next level by producing beers that are guaranteed to impress the savviest critic, yet also appealing to a widely diverse group of beer drinkers. Our brews are light bodied and refreshing, complimented by a fine balance of complex flavors and aromas.\r\n\r\nStaying true to this principle, Chameleon would like to introduce its flagship beer \u2013 Hop On Top extra-pale ale. This aromatic non-bitter brew features a complex bouquet of dried flowers and hops.

Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series.

After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.  So, they set to work, getting their hands dirty renovating the space that was the old Columbian Newspaper building to a working brewery and taproom.  Speaking of the newspaper, that\u2019s how the name came about.  Think of reading a hard copy paper and how your hands would look from getting newsprint all over them!
