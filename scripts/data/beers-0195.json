Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "id": "71LkGn", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.threefloydspub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-219-922-3565", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.535541, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516686, "updateDate": "2015-06-18 14:42:36", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "GoDmMT", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:16", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.3floyds.com/", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "219-922-4425", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Munster", "latitude": 41.535536, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516687, "updateDate": "2015-04-01 18:55:51", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Three Floyds", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-07-29 12:02:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-icon.png"}, "id": "iodDki", "name": "Three Floyds Brewing Company"}], "description": "This beer is brewed during the hop harvest with a portion of unkilned or \u201cwet\u201d hops fresh off the vine.
