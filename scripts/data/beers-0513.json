The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "30", "categoryId": 3, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "42", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.008", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:25:18", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "American Pale", "abvMax": "5.6", "id": 25, "srmMin": "6", "name": "American-Style Pale Ale"}, "createDate": "2016-06-21 18:51:26", "updateDate": "2016-06-21 18:51:26", "abv": "6.7", "styleId": 25, "id": "RPLvLS", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Hop Scotch", "nameDisplay": "Hop Scotch", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.072", "description": "Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied.
