Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm).

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "12", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:48", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "Scottish Heavy", "abvMax": "4", "id": 8, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Heavy Ale"}, "name": "Single Malt Scotch Ale", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:13", "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:05:36", "styleId": 8, "id": "0fFshV", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.yardsbrewing.com/", "established": "1994", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "In 1988, two cash-strapped collegiate wrestlers realized that they could sustain their thirst for quality beer without spending their modest savings at the local liquor store by brewing beer themselves.
