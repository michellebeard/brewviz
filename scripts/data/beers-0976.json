I was on the phone the next day with the hop merchants, but it would not be coming to the UK for another 10 months. I checked back often, even tracking the progress of the boat as it approached (delayed, of course!).\r\nMy memory of the power of that hop was so vivid. I did not want to have it compete for flavour with coloured malts, but there needed to be a balancing malt flavour to enhance drinkability. I managed to source a low coloured cara malt \u2013 difficult to malt, difficult to crush and very inefficient to work with, but adding good body and some honeyed sweetness. Rather than use traditional pale malt I went with a lighter lager malt to both lighten the colour and alter the malt profile.\r\nHops from New Zealand apparently come super-vac packed. The package was about half the size of a normal bag for the same weight. I hesitantly opened the bag, hoping my memory wasn\u2019t all roses. And I was far from disappointed! Uncle Fester was at the other end of the brewery about 50 metres away and could smell them from there even before I pulled the hops out of the bag. We still talk about that as one of our defining brewing moments. The brew day proceeded as normal until the transfer of the wort to the fermenter. Apart from the amazing aroma, the wort was pouring with an unmistakable green tinge.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "So'Hop", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/XAhf9S/upload_psxXWy-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/XAhf9S/upload_psxXWy-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/XAhf9S/upload_psxXWy-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 6, "name": "International Ale Styles"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "International-style pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
