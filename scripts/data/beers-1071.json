Other beers like the Rufus and Opal along with Sean Paxton\u2019s Saucerful of Secrets are still tucked away in the cellar in their original first generation form, gaining character with extended aging.   Velvet Merkin has established itself as a real barrel loving beer, although it is only 6%, it carries barrel qualities beautifully.  A new beer, that was created this year by our Cellar Master Ali Razi, is Double Double Barrel Ale and it found its way into this blend as well.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "12", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:48", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "Scottish Heavy", "abvMax": "4", "id": 8, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Heavy Ale"}, "createDate": "2013-02-02 12:51:53", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 22:26:47", "abv": "9.5", "styleId": 8, "id": "9qQDWT", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "Y", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.hambletonales.co.uk/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Hambleton Ales", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Melmerby", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Yorkshire", "longitude": -1.481851, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "44-(01765)-640108", "streetAddress": "Melmerby Green Road", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}, "latitude": 54.173598, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "erABL9", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Hambleton Ales", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:47:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/t8QNGc/upload_g7UQ2z-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/t8QNGc/upload_g7UQ2z-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/t8QNGc/upload_g7UQ2z-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/t8QNGc/upload_g7UQ2z-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/t8QNGc/upload_g7UQ2z-icon.png"}, "id": "t8QNGc", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "description": "What more to say?

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
