Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "12", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:48", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "Scottish Heavy", "abvMax": "4", "id": 8, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Heavy Ale"}, "createDate": "2015-09-08 20:48:23", "updateDate": "2015-09-08 20:48:23", "abv": "9", "styleId": 8, "id": "bbWLrq", "name": "The Main Monkey Business"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available at the same time of year, every year.", "id": 4, "name": "Seasonal"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "A collaborative brew with Kevin Watson from Allagash Brewing Co. in Portland, ME.

Beers were brewed on Sunday mornings, where biscuity malt and hop aromas would waft through their house waking up their two other housemates. Before too long they realised they wanted to brew these beers every day of the week and share their passion of brewing and drinking good beer with the rest of London.\r\n\r\nRecipes were put together, brewing vessels were purchased, an industrial premises was let and the brewery in Summerstown, London, was born. Alex Bull and Chris Mills, the co-founders, had put together a microbrewery based in South-West London which created small-batch full-flavoured ales. Initially, four flagship ales were brewed for cask ale and bottles, with new on-off limited edition beers being created every month.\r\n\r\nWithin 18 months of operation the brewery was expanded with new vessels installed and a Brewery Tap was added. The expansion enabled keg beers to be produced, including a variety of lagers and stronger craft keg beers, with our Brewery Tap serving our beers directly from where they are brewed.\u00ad\r\nWe now produce four flagship ales and at least three varying seasonal ales every month.
