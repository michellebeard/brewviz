Why Foxhole? Well, our last name means Fox in German and Liv in all her \"slyness\" thought our home was our foxhole. We got a few good laughs, threw a few homebrew parties and it stuck. There hasn't been a brewery in Willmar since 1899 and we think it's time to bring it back with fresh, local, handcrafted beer! Not the fizzy yellow stuff massed produced and stripped of all the wonderful flavors that are meant to be in there. I mean small batch, flavorful and aromatic beer.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

It is one of the last remaining authentic lambic breweries of Belgium and well known for its lambic beer brewed along traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nLambic matures up to three years in wooden barrels, whereupon it is blended to make Oude Geuze. Sour cherries undergo fermentation in lambic beer and after a second fermentation in the bottle Oude Kriek is born. This unique brewing process with spontaneous fermentation is possible in Belgium in the Pajottenland region, the Zenne Valley and in Brussels, because of the presence of a specific microflora.\r\n\r\nDue to the absence of succession in the family business at the end of 2002, the traditional lambic beers of Oud Beersel were threatened to disappear. Shocked by the loss of this cultural and historical patrimony, the brewery was taken over in 2005 and business was restarted pursuing the principal aim to protect the time-honoured lambic beers, as well as the cultural and historical heritage of Oud Beersel for the coming generations.\r\n\r\nThis traditional brewery of lambic beers is nowadays managed in a modern way with respect for tradition and the m\u00e9tier. The traditional part of the production process of the lambic beers, in particular the spontaneous fermentation, the maturation of lambic in wooden barrels and the mixture of various lambic casks and vintages constitutes the core business of the company. The production process is completed in close collaboration with excellent partners who manage the industrial equipment. By the synergy between the m\u00e9tier and the industry, Oud Beersel offers authentic products of the highest quality.\r\n\r\nThanks to the success of the special Bersalis beers, i.e. the high fermentation beers of Oud Beersel, investments are continuously made to optimize the production process, to achieve the most demanding quality standards and to extend the infrastructure for the time-honoured lambic beers of Oud Beersel in order to meet the always growing demand.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Beersel", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Vlaams Brabant", "longitude": 4.3047963, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "Laarheiestraat 230", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}, "latitude": 50.7599724, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "6xIUOg", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brouwerij Oud Beersel", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:41:56", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EFaa8I/upload_ICWtsd-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EFaa8I/upload_ICWtsd-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EFaa8I/upload_ICWtsd-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EFaa8I/upload_ICWtsd-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EFaa8I/upload_ICWtsd-icon.png"}, "id": "EFaa8I", "name": "Brouwerij Oud Beersel"}], "description": "Framboise Oud Beersel harmonizes the authentic taste of Oude Lambiek and the fruity flavour of ripe raspberries.
