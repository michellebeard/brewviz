This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.\r\nQuaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.\r\nWhen Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.\r\nOnce Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.\r\nCurrently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.\r\n\r\n\"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\" - William Shakespeare", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thur: 11:30am - 9pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30am - 10pm\r\nSun: 11:30am - 9pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Nashville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "id": "qZJOHj", "streetAddress": "60 Molly Ln", "postalCode": "47448", "website": "http://www.bigwoodsbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "813-988-6000", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.2079575, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -86.2484171, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Quaff On!", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-10-11 13:02:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-icon.png"}, "id": "f8oZ5j", "name": "Quaff On!
