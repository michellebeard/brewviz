In lieu of ice, the foggy night air naturally cooled the fermenting beer, creating steam off the warm open pans. Once a nickname for any West Coast beer brewed under these conditions, today the name \u201csteam\u201d is a trademark of Anchor Brewing and applies only to the singular process and taste of our flagship brand - San Francisco\u2019s original Anchor Steam\u00ae Beer.
