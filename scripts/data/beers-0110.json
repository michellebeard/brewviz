New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school.

Well, maybe our taproom/brewing facility isn\u2019t literally in our backyard \u2013 in fact we renovated a soda bottling plant to suit all of our production needs \u2013 but with such a close-knit and supportive community, every inch of Virginia feels like home.\r\n\r\nBrothers Craft Brewing (originally Three Brothers Brewing) was founded by the three Shifflett siblings, who used their collective experience to execute a singular vision: brew exciting, unique craft beers that emphasize and support our community.\r\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to realize that same community was our extended family. The three of us may be related by blood, but our staff, our customers, and our collaborators have all become brothers.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about the people we\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with and making sure we had the ability to continue to grow, we made the bold decision to rebrand our business as Brothers Craft Brewing.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges associated with such a change, we feel that our new name truly represents our evolution as a business. Why limit our brotherhood to three when we\u2019ve gained so much family already?\r\n\r\nWhen we started this endeavor, we couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined the growth we\u2019ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we\u2019ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we\u2019ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all for everything you\u2019ve done for us. Thank you for keeping our dream alive.\r\n\r\nCheers!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-02-23 14:39:19", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "8n537L", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Harrisonburg", "createDate": "2013-02-23 14:40:25", "streetAddress": "800 North Main St.", "postalCode": "22802", "website": "https://brotherscraftbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(540) 435-6008", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.4576002, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Virginia", "longitude": -78.8612002, "updateDate": "2016-09-14 13:02:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brothers Craft", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-02-19 20:57:46", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-icon.png"}, "id": "R4fiI1", "name": "Brothers Craft Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.054", "description": "Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.
