Although we've experimented with beer and hops in the distillery, we've never used rye or sour mash in the brewery\u2014until now. This Zymaster, Potrero Hill Sour-Mash IPA, begins in our distillery, where we prepare a 100% rye malt mash just as we would for our rye whiskey. After transferring it to a small open fermenter, we pitch the yeast and wait. Five days later, we mash it in the brewhouse, using a blend of pale barley malt and rye malt. Then we add the sour mash from the distillery, which lowers the pH of our brewery mash. By introducing sour mash before the boil instead of after it, we are able to create tartness in this brew without sourness. In the brewkettle, we use four additions of Nelson Sauvin, a dual-purpose hop from New Zealand. We also dry-hop with Nelson, which creates Zymaster 7's unique tropical aroma.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity.

A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
