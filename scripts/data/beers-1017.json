The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Our brewpub in Logan Square is a bustling, neighborhood institution where friends and families meet to enjoy the freshest beer in town. Opening our brewery has been a labor of love. We think you can see that in everything we do ranging from the details of our carved fists holding up our mahogany bar to the pungent hop aroma of our Anti-Hero IPA to our creative dishes like our bacon-fat popcorn.\r\n\r\nThe growth of craft breweries in the U.S. has been nothing short of a revolution and we're proud to be standing tall in this new crowd. The changing tastes of beer drinkers demand bigger flavors and more variety. That's exactly what we give you at Revolution Brewing. Our brewpub produces about 50 different beer styles each year. We've got session beers like Workingman Mild, hop-bombs like Double Fist and more bourbon barrel aged beers than you can shake a stave at. We have fun doing what we do and invite you to come in and join us.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon-Fri: 11am-2am\r\nSat: 10am-3am\r\nSun: 10am-2am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "id": "xjjDoA", "streetAddress": "2323 N Milwaukee Ave", "postalCode": "60647", "website": "http://revbrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "773-227-2739", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Brewpub", "latitude": 41.923363, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.698071, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Chicago", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.707668, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "773-588-2267", "streetAddress": "3340 N Kedzie Ave", "createDate": "2012-08-10 17:02:16", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "60618", "latitude": 41.941773, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "6gM8vr", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Revolution", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:55:57", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PHkaP0/upload_X9hrAl-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PHkaP0/upload_X9hrAl-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PHkaP0/upload_X9hrAl-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PHkaP0/upload_X9hrAl-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PHkaP0/upload_X9hrAl-icon.png"}, "id": "PHkaP0", "name": "Revolution Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.
