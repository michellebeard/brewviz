The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.

Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.\r\nQuaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.\r\nWhen Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.\r\nOnce Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.\r\nCurrently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.\r\n\r\n\"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\" - William Shakespeare", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thur: 11:30am - 9pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30am - 10pm\r\nSun: 11:30am - 9pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Nashville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "id": "qZJOHj", "streetAddress": "60 Molly Ln", "postalCode": "47448", "website": "http://www.bigwoodsbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "813-988-6000", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.2079575, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -86.2484171, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Quaff On!", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-10-11 13:02:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-icon.png"}, "id": "f8oZ5j", "name": "Quaff On!

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer.
