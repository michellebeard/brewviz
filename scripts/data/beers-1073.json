We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard.

Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style export ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style export ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style export ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "15", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "25", "abvMin": "4", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:56", "fgMax": "1.018", "shortName": "Scottish Export", "abvMax": "5.3", "id": 9, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Export Ale"}, "createDate": "2016-01-25 16:46:56", "updateDate": "2016-01-25 16:46:56", "abv": "5.3", "styleId": 9, "id": "0Bc7nn", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/9N3HX2/upload_tIuHxF-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/9N3HX2/upload_tIuHxF-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/9N3HX2/upload_tIuHxF-icon.png"}, "styleId": 30, "availableId": 2, "foodPairings": "To be honest\u2026just have the beer!", "id": "9N3HX2", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
