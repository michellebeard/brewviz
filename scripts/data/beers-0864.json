Version 2.0 has upgraded its spicy aroma, with hints of bubblegum and clove. Bold flavors will launch upon uncorking, as sage and lemongrass balance the tangy, zesty wheat malt profile. Rather than merely blending a wittier with an IPA, Reboot harmonizes distinctly fruity Belgian yeast overtones with big, fruity American hop notes by creating an herbal bridge between these two somewhat contradictory flavors.

The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA.   David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments.  David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.  David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory.  Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery.                   \r\n\r\nWith the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens.  The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over.  Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.  One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings.  The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece.  We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer.  Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.  Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice.   We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.  Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have  20+ years of experience.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life.   Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort.  Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.  Creature Comforts is the end result of the story of our past and the starting point for the story our future, and we look forward to writing that story with you.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-11-07 00:01:58", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tue:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 4:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Athens", "createDate": "2014-11-13 18:35:40", "id": "r9KC4e", "streetAddress": "271 W.

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance.

Ever since the beginnings of the American Beer Renaissance, I have wanted to brew my own great tasting beer and make it available to the beer drinking public and help people learn about and appreciate beer. Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious. Now after over 200 brews, BCB is in business!\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small, we call it a Nano-Brewery, we are hidden in the middle of 38 acres of woods in the heart of North Carolina. Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be. Our small batch brewing lets us assure you that each keg or bottle of beer will be as fresh and wonderful as though we were brewing it for ourselves to drink.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:55:26", "locations": [{"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "EfLTd6", "locationTypeDisplay": "Nano Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bear Creek", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:56:05", "streetAddress": "10538 NC 902 Hwy", "postalCode": "27207", "website": "http://www.bearcreekbrews.com/", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(919) 200-3930", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.6518126, "locationType": "nano", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -79.3329623, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qz4HmX", "locationTypeDisplay": "Nano Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bear Creek", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:56:06", "streetAddress": "10538 NC 902 Hwy", "postalCode": "27207", "website": "http://www.bearcreekbrews.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(919) 200-3930", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.6518126, "locationType": "nano", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -79.3329623, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Bear Creek Brews", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:52:57", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9GewxD/upload_lRNESO-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9GewxD/upload_lRNESO-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9GewxD/upload_lRNESO-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9GewxD/upload_lRNESO-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9GewxD/upload_lRNESO-icon.png"}, "id": "9GewxD", "name": "Bear Creek Brews"}], "description": "Our newest beer to fill our six-pack is Red\u2014an Irish Style Ale.\r\n\r\nRed is a traditionally styled Irish Ale with a hefty helping of malt, a little taste of roasted barley and some wonderful red color from the crystal malt, classically hopped with Fuggles and Kent Goldings.\r\n\r\nYou will really enjoy this winter warmer any time of the year.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Red", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/8ikyKx/upload_rI41sV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/8ikyKx/upload_rI41sV-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/8ikyKx/upload_rI41sV-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 2, "name": "Irish Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.
