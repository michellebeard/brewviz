Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.004", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:34:55", "fgMax": "1.016", "shortName": "Saison", "abvMax": "8.5", "id": 72, "srmMin": "4", "name": "French & Belgian-Style Saison"}, "createDate": "2016-05-04 20:45:05", "updateDate": "2016-05-04 20:45:05", "abv": "5.2", "styleId": 72, "id": "KTj2jx", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://struise.com/", "established": "2001", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "De Struise Brouwers (DSB) is a small beer company currently located in Oostvleteren, Belgium. In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.struisebrouwers.be/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Woesten", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "West-Vlaanderen", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "longitude": 2.7831, "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "Woesten", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2001", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "latitude": 50.900311, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qcAp7N", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "De Struise", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:44:16", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png"}, "id": "bjwFtZ", "name": "De Struise"}, {"website": "http://www.3floyds.com", "established": "1996", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Three Floyds Brewing Company LLC was founded in 1996 by brothers Nick and Simon with their father Mike Floyd.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness).

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making.
