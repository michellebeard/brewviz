From 1989 until 2003 it was brewed along with several other popular Bavarian beer styles at the brewpub on Victoria Street. While brewed there, it was known as Weizen. \r\n\r\nOur Weissbier is an authentic Bavarian style wheat beer and has attracted an extremely loyal following and wonderful reviews from some of the world's top beer writers. In 2002 Denison's Wheat Beer became rated #1 in the world in the 'German Hefeweizen' category on ratebeer.com, and has remained in that place to this date. \r\n\r\nDenison's Weissbier is true to style, served unfiltered and is very refreshing. Although its only ingredients are malted barley, malted wheat, imported hops, water and yeast, the special Bavarian yeast produces the classic but unusual flavours of a true wheat beer. Flavour notes such as banana, clove and vanilla are all present.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Denison's Weissbier", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/x2Vcib/upload_H1ZBAI-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/x2Vcib/upload_H1ZBAI-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/x2Vcib/upload_H1ZBAI-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 4, "name": "German Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.047", "description": "The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.
