With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port/ whiskey/ wine/ sherry/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:50", "shortName": "BBL Aged Strong", "id": 135, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Strong Beer"}, "id": "Dj5OOw", "createDate": "2015-05-18 15:36:53", "updateDate": "2015-05-18 15:36:53", "abv": "10", "styleId": 135, "ibu": "50", "name": "\"SuperDude!\" Barrel-Aged Russian Imperial Stout"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Ale brewed with pumpkin and spices.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "\"The Great Boo\" Pumpkin Ale", "breweries": [{"website": "http://greatbaraboo.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Great Baraboo Brewing Company", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "C5WSMS", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Clinton Township", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "streetAddress": "35905 Utica Road", "postalCode": "48035", "website": "http://greatbaraboo.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "586-792-7397", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.5601937, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -82.9649787, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Great Baraboo", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:11:47", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6XlqQv/upload_LQcGl9-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6XlqQv/upload_LQcGl9-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6XlqQv/upload_LQcGl9-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6XlqQv/upload_LQcGl9-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6XlqQv/upload_LQcGl9-icon.png"}, "id": "6XlqQv", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "Pumpkin beers are any beers using pumpkins (Cucurbito pepo) as an adjunct in either mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities.

The event center also has a gift shop, where you can buy Wisconsin Brewing Company apparel, gift items, and of course, beer.\r\n\r\nPut all these pieces together next to a scenic pond with access to bike trails and plenty of beautiful landscape and you can have one heck of a brewery experience.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:13", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Wauwatosa", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -88.0075875, "isClosed": "N", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:13", "status": "deleted", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "latitude": 43.0494572, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "CjMGUR", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Deleted"}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday CLOSED\r\nTues-Fri 3-9pm Tours 4, 5 & 6pm\r\nSat 10am-9pm Tours 10am-4pm every hour\r\nSun 10am-5pm Tours 10am-4pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Verona", "createDate": "2013-05-28 13:00:18", "id": "iHEJZm", "streetAddress": "1079 American Way", "postalCode": "53593", "website": "http://wisconsinbrewingcompany.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(608) 848-1079", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.9694364, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -89.5120484, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Wisconsin", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:02:50", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ho8CUc/upload_uDloyz-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ho8CUc/upload_uDloyz-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ho8CUc/upload_uDloyz-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ho8CUc/upload_uDloyz-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ho8CUc/upload_uDloyz-icon.png"}, "id": "ho8CUc", "name": "Wisconsin Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason\u2019s wedding to his son\u2019s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews.

Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason\u2019s wedding to his son\u2019s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy Black Hog Brewing Company at one of our pig roasts soon or whatever occasion brings you together for great beer and food with friends and family.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-08-24 01:04:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "LoZU74", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Oxford", "createDate": "2014-08-24 01:04:56", "streetAddress": "115 Hurley Rd", "latitude": 41.4757707, "extendedAddress": "Bldg 9A", "website": "http://www.blackhogbrewing.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "06478", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Connecticut", "longitude": -73.1520822, "updateDate": "2014-08-25 11:53:08", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Black Hog", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:57:58", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_KnhGJu-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_KnhGJu-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_KnhGJu-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_KnhGJu-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_KnhGJu-icon.png"}, "id": "WgTa5f", "name": "Black Hog Brewing Company"}], "description": "This beer had a long weekend in our brew kettle allowing beer bugs (Pediococcus and Latcobacillus) to get down get down and do their sour thang.
