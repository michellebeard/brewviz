Founder, Kenny Thacker, originally got into brewing beer as a business opportunity with a full-service homebrewing store, the Fermentation Trap.  Since that time, he has fallen in love with beer and brewing and felt compelled to do it professionally, and in 2012, Kenny opened Beer Hound Brewery.\r\n\r\nNot long after Beer Hound opened, friends & beer entrepreneurs Frank Becker & Rick Cash saw the potential in the great-tasting brews that were part of the Beer Hound lineup. They joined forces with Beer Hound Brewery and decided to bring the great tasting microbrews to the Town of Culpeper, Virginia.  In October of 2014, Beer Hound Brewery opened its doors as the first-ever brewery in Culpeper. Local and visiting beer enthusiasts descended upon the new establishment immediately and now the Beer Hound brand is a mainstay of the arts district in Downtown Culpeper.\r\n\r\nAll of the Beer Hound beers are named after famous hounds in movies and history, with an attempt to link the beer style to the hound.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer.
