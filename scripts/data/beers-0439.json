The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "30", "categoryId": 3, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "42", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.008", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:25:18", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "American Pale", "abvMax": "5.6", "id": 25, "srmMin": "6", "name": "American-Style Pale Ale"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:17", "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:04:50", "styleId": 25, "id": "fgvVYQ", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "srmId": 7, "styleId": 70, "availableId": 2, "foodPairings": "Great with desert!", "id": "9gcoIS", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "originalGravity": "1.085", "nameDisplay": "Goldie", "name": "Goldie", "abv": "10.5", "status": "verified", "description": "This Belgian Golden Strong Ale was aged in Bourbon for over 5 months.\r\n\r\nIn the barrel, aromas and flavors of coconut, vanilla, and bourbon combined with banana and ripe tropical fruit esters to create a massively complex and balanced barrel aged beer.", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "description": "Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style.
