Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:56", "shortName": "BBL Aged Sour", "id": 136, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer"}, "createDate": "2015-05-22 15:07:21", "updateDate": "2015-12-18 00:55:21", "styleId": 136, "availableId": 2, "id": "WkiW7b", "name": "Unison - The Fresh Oak Brett Project"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://rivertownbrewery.com/", "established": "2009", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Welcome to the Rivertown Brewing Company, We specialize in brewing traditional Handcrafted Lagers and Ales, using only the finest and freshest ingredients available.  use the buttons to the left to find out \"What Ales You\"!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:        4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nThu:         5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri:\t5:00 pm -10:00 pm\r\nSat:\t2:00 pm - 10:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "id": "eKF3uv", "streetAddress": "607 Shepherd Drive #6", "postalCode": "45215", "website": "http://rivertownbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-827-9280", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.236015, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.462885, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Rivertown", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:04:56", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DWjwcm/upload_Z5i1yf-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DWjwcm/upload_Z5i1yf-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DWjwcm/upload_Z5i1yf-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DWjwcm/upload_Z5i1yf-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DWjwcm/upload_Z5i1yf-icon.png"}, "id": "DWjwcm", "name": "Rivertown Brewing Company"}], "name": "Unit 6", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Unit 6", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/4Dg3u1/upload_dt5Pnl-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/4Dg3u1/upload_dt5Pnl-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/4Dg3u1/upload_dt5Pnl-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.036", "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.
