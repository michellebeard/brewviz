This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing.

It begins with just good, old-fashioned passion. Beer is our passion. We enjoy the history of beer, its humble, but amazing beginnings, the way it brings people together, and it\u2019s unbelievable versatility. We truly believe you should follow your passion and enjoy life. How better to do that than open Thirsty Planet Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nOur purpose then morphs into doing the right thing. For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing. A portion of our Yellow Armadillo Wheat sales will go to a local cancer research/support foundation, and a portion of our Thirsty Goat Amber sales will go to help purchase farm animals (maybe goats?) for needy people in third world countries. So, not only can we feel good for helping people, you can feel good every time you purchase Thirsty Planet beer.

Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DF5YsC", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "streetAddress": "30 Germania Street", "postalCode": "02130", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-372-1131", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.314449, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.103365, "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "MLUbXI", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2013-08-12 13:10:57", "streetAddress": "1625 Central Parkway", "postalCode": "45214", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-412-3200", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Cincinnati", "latitude": 39.1144986, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5222061, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Production Brewery", "locality": "Breinigsville", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.6290377, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 40.5759622, "streetAddress": "7880 Penn Drive", "createDate": "2015-11-30 20:24:56", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2007", "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "postalCode": "18031", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "XZ6L8a", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Boston Beer", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:24:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png"}, "id": "1wSztN", "name": "Boston Beer Company"}], "name": "Simcoe IPA", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Simcoe IPA", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vQnyd7/upload_iMpVOo-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vQnyd7/upload_iMpVOo-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vQnyd7/upload_iMpVOo-icon.png"}, "beerVariation": {"available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "srmId": 20, "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/GefuM7/upload_DQTjso-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/GefuM7/upload_DQTjso-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/GefuM7/upload_DQTjso-icon.png"}, "styleId": 30, "availableId": 1, "foodPairings": "Bring out the spice over the heat of buffalo wings with the hop character of a Samuel Adams\u00ae Latitude 48 IPA.", "id": "GefuM7", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "originalGravity": "1.0603", "nameDisplay": "Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA", "abv": "6", "status": "verified", "description": "Samuel Adams\u00ae Latitude 48 IPA is a unique IPA brewed with a select blend of hops from top German, English, and American growing regions all located close to the 48th latitude within the \u201chop belt\u201d of the Northern Hemisphere.

At the Bloomington Brewing Company, we make beers that we like to drink. That\u2019s the first rule. Great ingredients and attention to detail is the second. Our intention is not to grow a large brewery operation, our intention is to make great beer that we like to drink and to take care of our community.\r\n\r\nWe make only ales and they are available only on draft in Bloomington, Indianapolis and the surrounding communities. We do not bottle our beers. We\u2019re not against bottling, and we will assuredly reach a point in the future where we will package our beer, but no matter how good a beer is in the bottle, it can never be better than the beer coming from a well managed tap. Often it will be not nearly as good. Why? Draft beer is fresher; that\u2019s a big one. Packaging beer is a complicated process with lots of potential for bad things to happen.
