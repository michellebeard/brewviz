Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm).

Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor.
