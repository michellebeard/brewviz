After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar! \r\n\r\nTwo Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Iowa and Missouri.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:11", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nTuesday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nWednesday   3:00 - 11:00\r\nThursday      3:00 - 11:00\r\nFriday         12:00 - 12:00\r\nSaturday     12:00 - 12:00\r\nSunday        12:00 - 9:00", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Warrenville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:11", "id": "jeOXxz", "streetAddress": "30 w 315 Calumet Ave.", "postalCode": "60555", "website": "http://www.twobrotherstaphouse.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "630.393.2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Two Brothers Tap House", "latitude": 41.824453, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -88.212512, "updateDate": "2015-07-14 13:53:02", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "We are give tours EVERY Saturday at 1:00 and 2:30 and Sunday at 1:00.", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Warrenville", "createDate": "2012-01-26 12:57:18", "id": "YOdPoo", "streetAddress": "30W315 Calumet Ave.", "latitude": 41.824906, "website": "http://www.twobrosbrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "60555", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -88.211221, "updateDate": "2015-07-07 21:22:36", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thurs: 11:00 am - 12:00 am \r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am \r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Aurora", "createDate": "2012-01-26 12:59:51", "id": "AiMDyF", "streetAddress": "205 N.

This rendition of a Russian Imperial Stout is also infused with a blend of Mexican and Ethiopian fair-trade organic coffee. Complex and contemplative, and with well-integrated alcohol warmth, The Bottle Imp is best served in a snifter, sipped slowly and savoured.\r\nHistory & Style\r\n\r\nBeau\u2019s Pro-Am Series is a salute to homebrewers, true innovators of our craft. These beers are designed by amateur brewers, and brewed at Beau\u2019s. The Bottle Imp was brewed in collaboration with David Thompson, winner of the 2012 Toronto Beer Week Homebrew Contest.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Imperial Stout style is brewed to weigh in high on alcohol, with the roasted, malty character typical of a stout. The style was first brewed in England in the 18th century, and exported to Russia for the pleasure of Czarina Catherine II and her court.\r\n\r\nThe Bottle Imp is a haunting turn-of-the-century tale by Robert Louis Stevenson about risking eternal damnation of the soul to have everything on earth one\u2019s heart desires. We suggest pairing the beer and the story on a cold night by a crackling fire.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes\r\n\r\nThe Bottle Imp is black, rich and malty, with a mouthfeel best described as liquid silk. The roasty dark malt character is complemented by fruit notes that suggest dates and figs, as well as subtle notes of black licorice. It is well-hopped to provide balance to the malts, keeping the residual sweetness in check. The coffee character is fully integrated, and a complement to the roast of the malts. The experience is rich and intense, with gentle alcohol warmth, and a long, complex finish.\r\nThe coffee infused into The Bottle Imp are a Mexican dark roast from Chiapas region (chocolate malt, toasted spice flavours) and a medium-roast Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (floral, berries, tropical fruit flavours), both roasted by Bridgehead in Ottawa.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "The Bottle Imp", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kEMmNg/upload_p7ueVd-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kEMmNg/upload_p7ueVd-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kEMmNg/upload_p7ueVd-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.088", "id": "kEMmNg", "createDate": "2015-03-01 19:25:39", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 23:11:43", "abv": "9", "styleId": 16, "availableId": 2, "foodPairings": "Pumpernickel bread, trifle, dark chocolate fondue, coffee cake, grilled steak, truffle-oil-infused mashed potatoes, & sharp cheddar or stilton.", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.08", "description": "Dark copper to very dark brown, British-style imperial stouts typically have high alcohol content.

Further releases have included the 12 oz Resin and 3Beans, as well as 16oz seasonal offerings such as Apollo and Autumnation.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "mailingListUrl": "http://sixpoint.com/connect", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "QJRQhZ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Brooklyn", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "streetAddress": "40 Van Dyke St", "latitude": 40.6739685, "website": "http://www.sixpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2005", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "11231", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "New York", "longitude": -74.0119553, "updateDate": "2015-08-19 18:36:16", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Sixpoint", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:58:11", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_zewnMi-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_zewnMi-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_zewnMi-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_zewnMi-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_zewnMi-icon.png"}, "id": "7VPQrN", "name": "Sixpoint Brewery"}], "name": "The Brothers' Quinn", "nameDisplay": "The Brothers' Quinn", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/K9FnWx/upload_e1brkr-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/K9FnWx/upload_e1brkr-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/K9FnWx/upload_e1brkr-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 4, "name": "German Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.047", "description": "Bamberg-style Weiss Rauchbier should have smoky characters that range from detectable to prevalent in the aroma and flavor. Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.

It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "wbpj5b", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "streetAddress": "1675 N Western Ave", "latitude": 41.9124445, "website": "http://www.pipeworksbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "60647", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.6869011, "updateDate": "2016-07-22 20:13:38", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Pipeworks", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:04:15", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-icon.png"}, "id": "fz3g3i", "name": "Pipeworks Brewing Company"}], "name": "The Brown & Stirred", "nameDisplay": "The Brown & Stirred", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/F6Fcn9/upload_vdJHDd-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/F6Fcn9/upload_vdJHDd-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/F6Fcn9/upload_vdJHDd-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.
