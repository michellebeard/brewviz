Diamond Bear is brewed in Arkansas which is the only state to have a diamond mine. This is where the first part of our name came from.

Well, maybe our taproom/brewing facility isn\u2019t literally in our backyard \u2013 in fact we renovated a soda bottling plant to suit all of our production needs \u2013 but with such a close-knit and supportive community, every inch of Virginia feels like home.\r\n\r\nBrothers Craft Brewing (originally Three Brothers Brewing) was founded by the three Shifflett siblings, who used their collective experience to execute a singular vision: brew exciting, unique craft beers that emphasize and support our community.\r\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to realize that same community was our extended family. The three of us may be related by blood, but our staff, our customers, and our collaborators have all become brothers.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about the people we\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with and making sure we had the ability to continue to grow, we made the bold decision to rebrand our business as Brothers Craft Brewing.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges associated with such a change, we feel that our new name truly represents our evolution as a business. Why limit our brotherhood to three when we\u2019ve gained so much family already?\r\n\r\nWhen we started this endeavor, we couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined the growth we\u2019ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we\u2019ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we\u2019ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all for everything you\u2019ve done for us. Thank you for keeping our dream alive.\r\n\r\nCheers!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-02-23 14:39:19", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "8n537L", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Harrisonburg", "createDate": "2013-02-23 14:40:25", "streetAddress": "800 North Main St.", "postalCode": "22802", "website": "https://brotherscraftbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(540) 435-6008", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.4576002, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Virginia", "longitude": -78.8612002, "updateDate": "2016-09-14 13:02:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brothers Craft", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-02-19 20:57:46", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-icon.png"}, "id": "R4fiI1", "name": "Brothers Craft Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.047", "description": "This beer can be made using phenol producing ale yeast.
