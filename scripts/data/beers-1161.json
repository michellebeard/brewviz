Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month.

A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.

In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:5:00 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 3:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Fort Worth", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "id": "X6U0o8", "streetAddress": "701 Galveston Avenue", "postalCode": "76104", "website": "http://www.rahrbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2004", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "817-810-9266", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 32.7368128, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Texas", "longitude": -97.3275585, "updateDate": "2014-10-29 16:04:43", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Rahr & Sons", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-11-07 13:13:03", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_ixkkW0-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_ixkkW0-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_ixkkW0-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_ixkkW0-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_ixkkW0-icon.png"}, "id": "WCBdy2", "name": "Rahr & Sons Brewing Company"}], "ibu": "43", "servingTemperature": "cellar", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 04:27:18", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:02"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available at the same time of year, every year.", "id": 4, "name": "Seasonal"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Malty up front, showcasing the flavors of Munich malt and caramel, with a decidedly bitter finish.

Anchor Winter Wheat is made with a unique blend of malted barley and five wheats from Belgium, Germany, the Midwest, and a family farm just 75 miles away, where we get our soft red winter wheat. Sown in November and harvested in June, it is used in artisanal flatbreads, cakes and pastries. In 1848, California farmers forsook their amber grain for golden fortune. By 1878, California wheat was back big-time, winning gold at the Paris International Exposition. There was a even a wheat beer brewery in North Beach, one mile from our first home.

It\u2019s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It\u2019s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis pub is part of the community, and I don\u2019t just mean geographically,\u201d said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we\u2019re connected with the people and that they can trust that they\u2019ll feel at home here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he\u2019s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I\u2019ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s impressive.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown.

We hope to provide a product and establishment that our community can be proud of for many years to come!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-06-13 17:25:05", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tue - Thu:\t12:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat:\t12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun:\t12:00 pm - 11:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Marquette", "createDate": "2012-06-13 17:27:04", "id": "3Q48Ed", "streetAddress": "114 W Spring St", "postalCode": "49855", "website": "http://www.ore-dock.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2010", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "906-228-8888", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 46.541656, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -87.393837, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Ore Dock", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:29:41", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WNdNIc/upload_3OsRHF-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WNdNIc/upload_3OsRHF-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WNdNIc/upload_3OsRHF-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WNdNIc/upload_3OsRHF-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WNdNIc/upload_3OsRHF-icon.png"}, "id": "WNdNIc", "name": "Ore Dock Brewing Company"}], "name": "Winter Witbier", "nameDisplay": "Winter Witbier", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pzG17a/upload_tTjBGC-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pzG17a/upload_tTjBGC-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/pzG17a/upload_tTjBGC-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.
