After a decent study of the possibilities to start his own brewery, he decided to start with brewing in a existing brewery.

We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:13", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "SgctbA", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Portland", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:13", "streetAddress": "929 North Russell Street", "postalCode": "97227", "website": "http://www.widmer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "503-281-2437", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 45.540795, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -122.675594, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Widmer Brothers", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:02:38", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8wcv7h/upload_61693P-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8wcv7h/upload_61693P-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8wcv7h/upload_61693P-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8wcv7h/upload_61693P-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8wcv7h/upload_61693P-icon.png"}, "id": "8wcv7h", "name": "Widmer Brothers Brewing"}], "name": "Hop It Up", "nameDisplay": "Hop It Up", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/KeVJA0/upload_nyQuU1-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/KeVJA0/upload_nyQuU1-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/KeVJA0/upload_nyQuU1-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
