Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's.

In Europe and the UK every area had its own local brewery and the beer was fresh and had flavor and a lot of body. So his quest to bring premium fresh flavorful beers to his town was born.\r\n\r\nWorking as an apprentice with some of the original craft brewers in California, it gave him an a working knowledge and appreciation as well as insight into the business of craft beer. Heritage Brewing was co-founded by Mark in 1989 and was Orange County\u2019s first micro brewery (brewpub) and they also became known as the premier live blues venue in the OC. Several years later Mark founded his production facility in Riverside County and produced products under Heritage\u2019s label as well as producing white label products for restaurants such as Claim Jumper, Wahoo\u2019s, BJ\u2019s Pizza, etc. In addition, Mark's facility produced and packaged many bottled products that have sold in all major retailers throughout So Cal.\r\n\r\nMark has brewed on various systems from 7bbl to 110 bbl, as well as installations and recipe formulations for many local brewpubs. Mark has received numerous awards from local beer festivals, state fairs, national and international beer festivals. Having received over 20 awards ranging from best of show, blue ribbons, bronze, silver and gold, with a Gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival, you can rest assured that the philosophy surrounding Mark, is a quality product every time.

Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Fridays 3pm - 7pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Centralia", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "id": "TkT8Rc", "streetAddress": "5945 Prather Road", "postalCode": "98531", "website": "http://dicksbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-586-7760", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 46.771347, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -123.007543, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Dick's", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:44:31", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-icon.png"}, "id": "GC3a1f", "name": "Dick's Brewing Company"}], "name": "The Chronicle Reporter Red Ale", "nameDisplay": "The Chronicle Reporter Red Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/yuDKS6/upload_BT0EWJ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/yuDKS6/upload_BT0EWJ-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/yuDKS6/upload_BT0EWJ-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.048", "description": "American amber/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
