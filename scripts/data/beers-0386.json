Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used.

We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches.

I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer\u2019s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I\u2019m my own worst critic.  I\u2019m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn\u2019t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.\r\n\r\nSo, after all this research and planning, what\u2019s the plan?  Start small.\r\n\r\nJack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?\r\n\r\nThis little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.  It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment.  Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!  I\u2019ve been my own worst critic for the past 12 years of homebrewing.  Now it\u2019s your turn.  With your help, we can build a brewery to provide our friends and neighbors with delicious locally-brewed beer.\r\n\r\nSo, stop in and give it a try!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-01-16 22:52:53", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Friday 4-7pm\r\nSaturday 4-7pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Brainerd", "createDate": "2014-01-16 22:54:29", "id": "CPYUBy", "streetAddress": "7942 College Rd, Ste 115", "postalCode": "56425", "website": "http://jackpinebrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(218) 270-8072", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Jack Pine Brewery - Taproom", "latitude": 46.3447626, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Minnesota", "longitude": -94.2338287, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Jack Pine", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:50:13", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_QgLu1t-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_QgLu1t-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_QgLu1t-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_QgLu1t-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_QgLu1t-icon.png"}, "id": "3YeQjZ", "name": "Jack Pine Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 3, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:28:32", "shortName": "Sour", "id": 40, "name": "American-Style Sour Ale"}, "createDate": "2015-11-25 16:20:24", "updateDate": "2015-11-25 16:20:25", "abv": "9.5", "styleId": 40, "id": "RvZ0Tv", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Festbier", "nameDisplay": "Festbier", "breweries": [{"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Simmerberg", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Bayern", "longitude": 9.943129, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "49-(0)8387-/-3806", "streetAddress": "Ellhofer Strae 2", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "latitude": 47.586733, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "65NldW", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Simmerberg Brusttt und Taferne", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:58:08", "id": "GYF0P4", "name": "Simmerberg Brusttt und Taferne"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.05", "description": "M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.
