Butterfields Brewing Company evolved into Sequoia Brewing Co in 2003 and during his tenure with both breweries he won five gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, as well as numerous regional and State awards.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "id": "qo6LCf", "streetAddress": "1621 Moore St.", "postalCode": "45202", "website": "http://www.christianmoerlein.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1853", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-827-6025", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom", "latitude": 39.1137948, "locationType": "tasting", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5150108, "updateDate": "2014-12-15 02:45:48", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm, 11:00am - 1:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm, 11:00am - 10:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-08-02 18:10:31", "id": "X0HMO8", "streetAddress": "115 Joe Nuxhall Way", "postalCode": "45202", "website": "http://www.moerleinlagerhouse.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-421-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Christian Moerlein Lager House", "latitude": 39.0963619, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5087017, "updateDate": "2014-12-15 02:46:10", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Christian Moerlein", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:11:17", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_DkG1sa-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_DkG1sa-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_DkG1sa-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_DkG1sa-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_DkG1sa-icon.png"}, "id": "Em1uno", "name": "Christian Moerlein Brewing Company"}], "name": "Much A-Brew About Nothing", "nameDisplay": "Much A-Brew About Nothing", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Vmrxqi/upload_7nUd9y-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Vmrxqi/upload_7nUd9y-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Vmrxqi/upload_7nUd9y-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 8, "name": "North American Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

Generally a \"chocolate stout\" is so named for it's color, not specifically for any particular flavor profiles. In fact, stouts are more notable for strong coffee or roasted barley flavors than anything else. However, in the case of Muddy Creek, we have actually made efforts to incorporate chocolate flavors into the recipe which enhance the aroma, flavor and natural bitterness of the stout. These flavors mix naturally with the coffee undercurrent of the stout to form a nice blend. Add the silky mouth-feel from the oats and you have a very unique experience.\r\n\r\n We were so happy with how Muddy Creek turned out as a beer that we named the brewery after it.
