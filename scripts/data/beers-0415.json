Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

A U.S. Army Ranger, Jim had just returned Stateside from Haiti when he attended a party hosted by Dr. Jack Blalock. At the soiree, he was introduced to a kindred soul named William Gantt. Their conversation soon turned to the quality of beer in Columbus. Needless to say, the tone was bitter and the language seasoned with expletives. When Jim explained that in Oregon, where he came of age, there was a vibrant scene of restaurants and bars that housed their own microbreweries that crafted their own distinct beers that could only be enjoyed at the source, Gantt understandably replied, \"$#@*!\".\r\n\r\nWhat began as a conversation soon became an obsession and, in 1996, the firm Warner and Worth was incorporated to see their shared dream come true.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "VCsRkP", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Columbus", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "streetAddress": "1041 Broadway", "postalCode": "31901", "website": "http://thecannonbrewpub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "706-653-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 32.4663533, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Georgia", "longitude": -84.9935198, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "The Cannon Brewpub", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:16:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_4ELzcA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_4ELzcA-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_4ELzcA-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_4ELzcA-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_4ELzcA-icon.png"}, "id": "9vSKac", "name": "The Cannon Brewpub"}], "srm": {"hex": "A63E00", "id": 18, "name": "18"}, "servingTemperature": "cold", "updateDate": "2015-04-29 18:00:37", "ibu": "41", "createDate": "2013-08-15 02:45:44"}, {"available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "srmId": 11, "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/EA5y03/upload_uiTnN9-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/EA5y03/upload_uiTnN9-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/EA5y03/upload_uiTnN9-icon.png"}, "styleId": 117, "availableId": 1, "foodPairings": "Citrus vinaigrette\r\nPad thai", "id": "EA5y03", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "originalGravity": "1.061", "ingredients": {"hops": [{"forAroma": "Y", "alphaAcidMax": 13, "myrceneMax": 65, "cohumuloneMax": 24, "farneseneMax": 1, "forFlavor": "Y", "id": 27, "humuleneMax": 13, "category": "hop", "createDate": "2013-06-24 16:07:28", "isNoble": "N", "humuleneMin": 11, "betaAcidMax": 4.5, "cohumuloneMin": 22, "myrceneMin": 60, "alphaAcidMin": 11, "description": "Comprised of Hallertau Mittelfr\u00fch, US Tettnang, Brewer's Gold and East Kent Golding", "betaAcidMin": 3.5, "caryophylleneMax": 8, "caryophylleneMin": 6, "name": "Citra", "categoryDisplay": "Hops", "updateDate": "2015-09-24 13:38:05", "forBittering": "N"}, {"myrceneMax": 65, "category": "hop", "farneseneMax": 1, "description": "Simcoe is a dual-purpose hop variety which its grower claims is similar in character to Amarillo.

There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.
