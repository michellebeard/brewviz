Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:48", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "Qs29uy", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Frederick", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:48", "streetAddress": "124 North Market Street", "postalCode": "21701", "website": "http://www.brewers-alley.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "301-631-0089", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.4156043, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Maryland", "longitude": -77.4107676, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Laurel", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "MD", "longitude": -76.860565, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 39.1426709, "createDate": "2016-03-14 17:43:05", "status": "deleted", "updateDate": "2016-05-01 14:34:43", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "20723", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "RW6Da0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "statusDisplay": "Deleted"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brewer's Alley Restaurant", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:05:53", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_q7kWln-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_q7kWln-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_q7kWln-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_q7kWln-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_q7kWln-icon.png"}, "id": "wFeIiC", "name": "Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery"}], "description": "K\u00f6lsch is a variant of the traditional German ales that originated in and around Cologne.

Originating in Cologne (K\u00f6ln in German, both the dialect spoken and a person hailing from that city are called 'K\u00f6lsch'), K\u00f6lsch is a modern descendant of the Medieval Rhenish Ale brewed throughout the region north of Munich, a distinction it shares with the nearby Dusseld\u00f6rf Alt (you will hear more about this style in the near future). As demand for light colored beers grew, Cologne's brewers first developed a beer brewed mostly with wheat, quite similar to the German Weisse, called 'Keutebier'. Probably similar to a Belgian Wit, but lacking that beer's spices, Keutebier dominated brewing production in Cologne for almost 300 years. It wasn't until the 19th century that wheat started to disappear from the recipe, gradually replaced by Pilsner, until Keutebier had morphed into the modern K\u00f6lsch. 1906 is generally credited as the year modern K\u00f6lsch was first brewed by the S\u00fcnner Brewery. This new beer's popularity grew quickly, inspiring many brewers throughout the area to brew something similar. In 1946, the first agreement was signed by participating brewers that defined K\u00f6lsch. Throughout a turbulent history, many more agreements and legal battles have been waged until K\u00f6lsch was finally recognized by the EU with regional protections similar to those enjoyed by wine. Today a true K\u00f6lsch is brewed only in Cologne or the immediate area, but beers inspired by K\u00f6lsch are brewed all over the world. Clandestine's 'K\u00f6lsch I Can' is brewed with the same spirit as its German cousins: it is a subtle, malty, clean, crisp ale that has been lagered to reach peak flavors. Respectful of tradition, this beer is brewed only with German malts and hops. Soft water is used to push the malt flavors to the forefront of this still delicate beer.
