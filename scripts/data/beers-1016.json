Our product line includes a set of four year-round beers and small batch releases that give us a chance to try out new ideas. Our low ABV year-round beers allow you to enjoy more than one without feeling like you were hit by a truck the next day.\r\n\r\nGentile Brewing Company can be easily found in downtown Beverly, steps from the Beverly Depot MBTA station. The building at 59 Park Street was built in 1884 and originally housed Creesy Shoe Factory, among many other manufacturers over its storied 130 plus year history. Our beers pay homage to those who worked and lived in the Beverly community all of those years ago.

After years of home brewing and sharing beer with friends and family, it occurred to me that it was time to turn this hobby in to a business.  Something I could enjoying doing day in and day out, \u201cthe dream job.\u201d  \r\n\r\nWith a lot of hard work  Glasstown Brewing Company opened on December 20, 2013.  Glasstown Brewing Company was named after the rich history of the City of Millville.  The town for which the brewery bases its name, was once the glass making center for the country.  This unique town and plentiful silica resources made Millville one of the premier locations in the country for glass making.  Millville has had a rich and vibrant history, which is still prevalent in its Glasstown Arts District and the Clay College which continues to educate artists.  The brewery is proud to share in the history of Millville and its name as Glasstown Brewing Company.  The brewery is also proud to be located at The Millville Airport where it is located with in the Army Airfield Historic District.
