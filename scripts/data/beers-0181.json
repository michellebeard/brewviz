The outcome of their inspiration was Full Sail\u2019s Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout, an annual celebration of the best of American beer and American bourbon. With a tip of the hat to the Scotsman that inspired the idea, we offer this finely crafted beer for a limited time.\r\n\r\nOur Bourbon Aged Imperial Stout is a highly anticipated release from our Brewmaster's cellar. This beer was brewed in November of 2015 and was carefully aged for months in Wild Turkey Bourbon casks from Kentucky. This extended aging presents hints of vanilla and allows the Stout to pick up the flavors of the wood, bourbon and oak. The aging accentuates the robust character of the Imperial Stout and brings out the depth of flavor from the bourbon creating an overall elegantly sophisticated beer. \r\n\r\nThis year\u2019s Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout is inky black with aroma of dried cherry, shaved chocolate, and whiskey.
