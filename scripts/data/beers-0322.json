New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:27", "shortName": "BBL Aged", "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "id": "hqDjyf", "createDate": "2015-04-27 17:51:41", "updateDate": "2015-04-27 17:51:41", "abv": "10.4", "styleId": 132, "availableId": 2, "ibu": "52", "name": "Double Black"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Beer is not available.", "id": 3, "name": "Not Available"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://saugatuckbrewing.com/", "established": "2005", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Saugatuck Brewing Co. is a traditional Irish style pub that features 15 house-made drafts, hard cider and wines.

Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DF5YsC", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "streetAddress": "30 Germania Street", "postalCode": "02130", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-372-1131", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.314449, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.103365, "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "MLUbXI", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2013-08-12 13:10:57", "streetAddress": "1625 Central Parkway", "postalCode": "45214", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-412-3200", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Cincinnati", "latitude": 39.1144986, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5222061, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Production Brewery", "locality": "Breinigsville", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.6290377, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 40.5759622, "streetAddress": "7880 Penn Drive", "createDate": "2015-11-30 20:24:56", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2007", "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "postalCode": "18031", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "XZ6L8a", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Boston Beer", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:24:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png"}, "id": "1wSztN", "name": "Boston Beer Company"}], "description": "Cloaked in mystery and darkness, this style was originally stored in deep caves in the shadowy forests of Eastern Germany.

In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters.

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:51", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "yX6twV", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Baltimore", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:51", "streetAddress": "4615-B Hollins Ferry Road", "postalCode": "21227", "website": "http://www.hsbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "410-247-7822", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.230827, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Maryland", "longitude": -76.6751309, "updateDate": "2014-11-20 13:52:46", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nTue:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nWed:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nThu:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nFri:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Baltimore", "createDate": "2012-05-23 22:13:06", "id": "vh3ZUn", "streetAddress": "1300 Bank Street", "postalCode": "21231", "website": "http://heavyseasalehouse.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(410) 753-1403", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Heavy Seas Alehouse - Baltimore", "latitude": 39.286626, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Maryland", "longitude": -76.598808, "updateDate": "2014-11-20 13:51:07", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Arlington", "createDate": "2014-11-20 13:52:30", "id": "gmfbj6", "streetAddress": "1501 Wilson Blvd", "postalCode": "22209", "website": "http://heavyseasalehouse.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(703) 879-4388", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Heavy Seas Alehouse - Arlington", "latitude": 38.8952016, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Virginia", "longitude": -77.0742466, "updateDate": "2014-11-20 13:52:46", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Heavy Seas Beer", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-11-15 16:00:27", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wTFQaf/upload_PIyQtO-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wTFQaf/upload_PIyQtO-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wTFQaf/upload_PIyQtO-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wTFQaf/upload_PIyQtO-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wTFQaf/upload_PIyQtO-icon.png"}, "id": "wTFQaf", "name": "Heavy Seas Beer"}], "ibu": "90", "servingTemperature": "cold", "updateDate": "2015-12-18 01:53:58", "createDate": "2015-05-21 13:29:41"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Double Centennial Ale", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "nameDisplay": "Double Centennial Ale", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.lengthwise.com/", "established": "1998", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Lengthwise Brewing Company was established in 1998 in order to follow the Great American Dream of turning passion into product.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.
