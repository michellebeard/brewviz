Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers.

They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hefeweizen, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a four-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The room was once the storage area for The Boy Scouts of America Aurora chapter\u2019s canoes and the area gained the nickname \u201cCanoe Room,\u201d which stuck.\r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale).

We welcome you as our guests to stop by and try a glass of Peter's hard work.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:02", "locations": [{"status": "update_pending", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 6:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Manchester", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:02", "id": "8gAMPa", "streetAddress": "500 Commercial Street", "postalCode": "03101", "website": "http://millystavern.com/", "statusDisplay": "Update Pending", "yearOpened": "2002", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "603-625-4444", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewpub", "latitude": 42.9940958, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "New Hampshire", "longitude": -71.467279, "updateDate": "2016-12-02 23:06:35", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Milly's Tavern", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:52:24", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DTsVn8/upload_IvUQ57-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DTsVn8/upload_IvUQ57-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DTsVn8/upload_IvUQ57-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DTsVn8/upload_IvUQ57-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DTsVn8/upload_IvUQ57-icon.png"}, "id": "DTsVn8", "name": "Milly's Tavern"}], "originalGravity": "1.06", "id": "VuzlHY", "createDate": "2012-04-23 00:50:33", "updateDate": "2015-04-29 16:17:57", "abv": "5.9", "styleId": 18, "availableId": 4, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
