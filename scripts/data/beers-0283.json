The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

Their love of beer began in the 90\u2019s, which eventually lead to homebrewing, and an endless pursuit of finding the best craft beers the World had to offer.\r\n\r\nThey chose the name \"Chandeleur\" in honor of one of their favorite places, the Chandeleur Islands off the coast of Mississippi. The uninhabited island chain is approximately 50 miles long and is home to some of the best redfish and speckled trout fishing on the planet.\r\n\r\nCam and Cain were born and raised in Gulfport, MS. Being raised on the coast instilled in them a true love for the water. When they\u2019re not brewing beer, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to find them fishing or cruising in a boat with family.\r\n\r\nAs they gained a real passion for craft beer and continued to hone their homebrewing skills, they began to dream about opening their own microbrewery. Several years later, in July of 2012, Senate Bill 2878 became law, raising the permissible alcohol content in Mississippi beer from 5% by weight (6.25%ABV) to 8% by weight (10.1% ABV). The fellas knew that it was high time to start making their dream into a reality. And, they knew that Mississippi was the place to do it.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2013, they purchased a historic building in downtown Gulfport and broke ground for what is now Chandeleur Brewing Company. Their vision is to handcraft some of the most excellent ales on the Gulf Coast using only the finest, freshest malted barley, hops, and local ingredients.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-03-08 03:01:40", "mailingListUrl": "info@chandeleurbrew.com", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Thu:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 4:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Gulfport", "createDate": "2015-03-08 03:01:40", "id": "n7K72G", "streetAddress": "2711 14th Street", "postalCode": "39501", "website": "http://www.chandeleurbrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2015", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "228-701-9985", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 30.367822, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Mississippi", "longitude": -89.09537, "updateDate": "2015-03-13 17:16:03", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Chandeleur", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:05:40", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJFd7Y/upload_JJE9yV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJFd7Y/upload_JJE9yV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJFd7Y/upload_JJE9yV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJFd7Y/upload_JJE9yV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJFd7Y/upload_JJE9yV-icon.png"}, "id": "nJFd7Y", "name": "Chandeleur Brewing Company"}], "description": "This brown porter base is loaded with tons of roasted malts giving it a plethora of flavors from coffee to chocolate to toffee.
