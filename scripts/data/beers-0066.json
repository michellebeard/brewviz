The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it\u2019s capacity, and soon Fegley\u2019s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities. Perhaps there\u2019s another fragrant wallflower ready to dance.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "Jio9R0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Allentown", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "streetAddress": "812 W Hamilton St", "postalCode": "18101", "website": "http://www.thebrewworks.com/allentown-brewworks/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1998", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "610.433.7777", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Fegley's Allentown Brew Works", "latitude": 40.6013531, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.4739451, "updateDate": "2015-10-21 15:03:28", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Fegley's Bethlehem Brew Works", "locality": "Bethlehem", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.3821851, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "610-882-1300", "streetAddress": "569 Main Street", "createDate": "2015-10-21 15:03:28", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-10-21 15:03:28", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "18018", "latitude": 40.6222629, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "SAPoSh", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Fegley's Brew Works", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:38:31", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-icon.png"}, "id": "Rx4Dnt", "name": "Fegley's Brew Works"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.085", "description": "British-style barley wines range from tawny copper to dark brown in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

In perfect timing for October / Halloween, Aries is a delicious blend of Old Heathen Imperial Stout and Imperial Pumpkin Ale!\r\n\r\nKnown around the brewery as a \u201cBlack & Orange\u201d, this mix is generally credited to Weyerbacher\u2019s Philly Sales Rep Mike Lubieski as being a way to support his Flyers and also by NJ Sales Rep Natalie DeChico who got it into firkins here and there (she\u2019s the former Philly Beer Geek and creator of Althea).  By mixing these two brews, the otherwise pretty dominant cinnamon and nutmeg spices of Imperial Pumpkin Ale are subdued by Old Heathen while highlighting the malt backbone of both beers. The result is a really balanced yet spicy dark beer which will work very well as a dessert beer and still pair nicely with your favorite fall foods.\r\n\r\nSince both Old Heathen and Imperial Pumpkin Ale are each 8% ABV, Aries is also a very manageable 8% [really complicated math here].\r\n\r\nWhen Aries was originally conceived, the plan was to mix Heresy\u2014our Bourbon barrel-aged Old Heathen\u2014with Imperial Pumpkin Ale.

The color reflects the choice of fruit. Sourness is an important part of the flavor profile, though sweetness may compromise the intensity. These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and range from a dry to a full-bodied mouthfeel. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "15", "categoryId": 5, "ibuMax": "21", "abvMin": "5.6", "fgMin": "1.008", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:32:47", "fgMax": "1.016", "shortName": "Fruit Lambic", "abvMax": "8.6", "id": 68, "name": "Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:43", "updateDate": "2015-04-01 20:37:45", "abv": "4", "styleId": 68, "id": "ppyy1V", "name": "Arizona Peach"}]
