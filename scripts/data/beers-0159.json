The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "S2n5TB", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "streetAddress": "1800 West Fulton Street", "postalCode": "60612", "website": "http://www.gooseisland.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-466-7363", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.887107, "locationType": "production", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.6720969, "updateDate": "2014-09-11 10:33:51", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "D2gG2C", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "1800 North Clybourn Avenue", "postalCode": "60614", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1988", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-466-7363", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Clybourn", "latitude": 41.9137242, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.65373, "updateDate": "2014-09-11 10:32:55", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Goose Island", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:46:51", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png"}, "id": "APW1BC", "name": "Goose Island Beer Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Paddleboard Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They brew many seasonals throughout the year including: Snow Park XPA, Slippery Slope, Skookum Creek Ale, Paulina Lake Pilsner, Waste Deep Weiss, Riverside Red, Silverback Imperial Stout, Kolsch, IRA, etc. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery store.\r\n\r\nPHIL BREY \u2013 HEAD BREWER\r\nPhil brings 25 years of winemaking and brewing experience to Cascade Lakes Brewing Co. Phil started home brewing in college while working on his degree in Enology (winemaking) at Fresno State. Phil started with some winemaking stints in California at Mirassou Winery and Bogle Vineyards before moving to Bend. He began his professional brewing career at Deschutes Brewery. After some time over in the valley making wine at Benton-Lane Winery and Spindrift Cellars, and brewing at Oregon Trail Brewery, Phil returned to the High Desert to brew at Cascade Lakes, where he has worked since 2010. When Phil isn\u2019t producing some sort of alcohol, he can be found mountain biking, hiking, gardening and spending time with family.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "O2ScDy", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Redmond", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:50", "streetAddress": "2141 SW First Street", "postalCode": "97756", "website": "http://cascadelakes.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1994", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "541-923-3110", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.256031, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -121.169251, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Open Sunday \u2013 Thursday 11:30 am \u2013 10:00 pm\r\nFriday- Saturday 11:30 am \u2013 11:00 am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Redmond", "createDate": "2012-10-23 14:05:35", "id": "C7u6RO", "streetAddress": "855 SW 7th Street", "postalCode": "97756", "website": "http://cascadelakes.com/pubs/7th-street/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "541-923-1795", "isClosed": "N", "name": "7th Street Brew House", "latitude": 44.2687763, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -121.1757063, "updateDate": "2016-07-03 15:46:44", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Open 11:30 am -10:00 pm seven days a week.", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bend", "createDate": "2012-10-23 14:06:49", "id": "oRcuap", "streetAddress": "1441 SW Chandler Ave Suite 100", "postalCode": "97702", "website": "http://www.cascadelakes.com/pubs/lodge/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2004", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "541-388-4998", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Cascade Lakes Lodge", "latitude": 44.0414862, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -121.3329318, "updateDate": "2016-06-24 12:35:50", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:00am -
