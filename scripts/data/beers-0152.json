Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer.

Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association\u2019s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:56", "shortName": "BBL Aged Sour", "id": 136, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer"}, "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 8, "name": "Tulip"}, "glasswareId": 8, "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cellar - (12-14C/54-57F)", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.beerKC.com", "established": "1997", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Over 10 house brewed beers on tap at any given time served with American Comfort food with a twist.\r\n\r\nWe have been making beer for over 17 years and are one of the most popular brew pubs in the Kansas City area.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:01", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Sat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 12:00 am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Kansas City", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:01", "id": "Z05Zrr", "streetAddress": "4057 Pennsylvania Avenue", "postalCode": "64111", "website": "http://www.mccoyskc.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(816) 960-0866", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.0534374, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Missouri", "longitude": -94.5918844, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "McCoy's Public House and Brewkitchen", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:51:51", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WtMfgN/upload_2j4cdg-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WtMfgN/upload_2j4cdg-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WtMfgN/upload_2j4cdg-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WtMfgN/upload_2j4cdg-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WtMfgN/upload_2j4cdg-icon.png"}, "id": "WtMfgN", "name": "McCoy's Public House and Brewkitchen"}], "ibu": "11", "servingTemperature": "cellar", "updateDate": "2014-08-05 11:17:25", "createDate": "2014-08-04 17:32:20"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.bluemoonbrewingcompany.com/", "established": "1995", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "At Blue Moon Brewing Company\u00ae, we believe brewing is an art.

He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market.

Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used.
