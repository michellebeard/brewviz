That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century.

They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen.

In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "S2n5TB", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "streetAddress": "1800 West Fulton Street", "postalCode": "60612", "website": "http://www.gooseisland.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-466-7363", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.887107, "locationType": "production", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.6720969, "updateDate": "2014-09-11 10:33:51", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "D2gG2C", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "1800 North Clybourn Avenue", "postalCode": "60614", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1988", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-466-7363", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Clybourn", "latitude": 41.9137242, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.65373, "updateDate": "2014-09-11 10:32:55", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Goose Island", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:46:51", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png"}, "id": "APW1BC", "name": "Goose Island Beer Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.074", "description": "Malty sweetness is dominant but should not be cloying.
