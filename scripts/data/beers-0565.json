This blended amber ale was designed with Andy Arndt of Aquariva. We\u2019ve created a sessionable, malty red ale and blended in two small batches of the same beer fermented, respectively, with bay leaf and savory. The spices make this a great \u201cfood beer,\u201d but it\u2019s the drinkability and crisp malt profile that will keep bringing you back for more.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Italian Amber", "id": "LLDpoF", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-02-15 12:55:22", "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:05:49", "abv": "4.7", "availableId": 4, "glasswareId": 5, "ibu": "24", "name": "Italian Amber"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Strong Ale refined in barrels previously used to age an excellent Italian Grappa. \r\nFine and elegant beer with fragrances of Grappa and French oak wood.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Italian Strong Ale", "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Warm - (14-16C/57-61F)", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "Light amber to mid-range brown in color, strong ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness and may have low levels of roast malt character.

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
