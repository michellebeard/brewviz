From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "krIs45", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Juneau", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "streetAddress": "5429 Shaune Dr", "postalCode": "99801-9540", "website": "http://www.alaskanbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "907-780-5866", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Location", "latitude": 58.3570171, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alaska", "longitude": -134.4893459, "updateDate": "2015-12-03 19:08:04", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Alaskan", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:38:23", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-icon.png"}, "id": "VPHkaP", "name": "Alaskan Brewing Co."}], "description": "English Ales are typically malty-sweet, often with a rich, caramel or toffee-like character.

Historically, hops from Saaz (?atec) were considered among the finest in Europe, and were the backbone of the original Bohemian Pilsner; ?atec (Saaz in German) is in the area in NW part of Bohemia of the modern-day Czech Republic. In brewing, Saaz usually refers to the hop cultivar traditionally associated with Saaz and Bohemian Pilsner. Although the traditional name for this hop would be Saazer (or Saaz Saazer when grown in the Saaz area), it is generally simply referred to as Saaz or Czech Saaz. zech Saaz is grown not only in ?atec area but also in Tr?ice area (Central Moravia) and ?st? n/L area (North Bohemia). Saazer hops are also grown in other countries. Saaz grown outside of the Czech Republic will have different characteristics and will generally be identified by their nation of origin: for example, Saaz (American). True Saaz Saazer hops are prized for their mild, pleasant flavor, and are the only choice for brewing an authentic Pilsner.", "betaAcidMin": 3, "caryophylleneMax": 12, "caryophylleneMin": 10, "name": "Saaz (Czech)", "countryOfOrigin": "CZ", "country": {"displayName": "Czech Republic", "name": "CZECH REPUBLIC", "isoThree": "CZE", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 203, "isoCode": "CZ"}, "categoryDisplay": "Hops", "updateDate": "2013-06-24 16:10:38"}, {"category": "hop", "createDate": "2013-06-24 16:07:31", "categoryDisplay": "Hops", "id": 60, "name": "Hallertauer Perle"}, {"myrceneMax": 48, "farneseneMax": 15, "cohumuloneMax": 24, "id": 130, "humuleneMax": 23, "category": "hop", "createDate": "2013-06-24 16:07:37", "farneseneMin": 11, "humuleneMin": 6, "betaAcidMax": 6, "cohumuloneMin": 21, "myrceneMin": 44, "alphaAcidMin": 4.5, "description": "Sterling is a relatively new diploid aroma variety, developed from, among other parents, Saaz, Cascade, Brewer's Gold, and Early Green.
