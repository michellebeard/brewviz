This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nOur brewing system also wouldn\u2019t be complete without putting thought into the storage of our beer. Many fantastic beers leave breweries and then suffer the consequences of entering the distribution chain that wasn\u2019t at all designed to deal with craft beer. At Garage Brewing Co, we choose our guest beer that has been handled with the utmost care, and we store our own beer just steps from where it was brewed and fermented. Our 10 BBL serving vessels ensure beer delivery in its freshest form and our draft/tap system is highly engineered to ensure that we can pour our guests a proper pint.\r\n\r\nMany hours of thought and years of experience have been drawn from to ensure that Garage Brewing Co not only produces and serves and exceptional beer to its guests but does so in a way that respects the old world traditions.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-04-15 13:24:23", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Temecula", "createDate": "2014-04-15 13:25:18", "id": "Jki0lE", "streetAddress": "29095 Old Town Front Street", "postalCode": "92590", "website": "http://www.garagebrewco.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(951) 587-2537", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.4825051, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1432478, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Garage Brewing", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-01-19 22:24:25", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wGMKzx/upload_fKNQhd-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wGMKzx/upload_fKNQhd-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wGMKzx/upload_fKNQhd-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wGMKzx/upload_fKNQhd-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wGMKzx/upload_fKNQhd-icon.png"}, "id": "wGMKzx", "name": "Garage Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.08", "description": "See British Origin American-Style Imperial Porter Imperial porters are very dark brown to black in color.

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "10", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "4", "ibuMax": "17", "abvMin": "4.8", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:32:30", "fgMax": "1.01", "shortName": "Witbier", "abvMax": "5.2", "id": 65, "srmMin": "2", "name": "Belgian-Style White (or Wit) / Belgian-Style Wheat"}, "createDate": "2014-07-07 20:34:30", "updateDate": "2014-07-09 14:54:00", "abv": "4.8", "styleId": 65, "id": "hxdV7k", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}]
