Barrette resolved that he would return to the area after wintering in Frenchtown.  It was possibly on this trip that he met Adolph Lozeau, another French-Canadian. Lozeau operated a ranch about five miles east of the mouth of Cedar. His Forty Mile House had been a wayfarer\u2019s stop along the Mullan Road for two years.\r\nIt was not until the next fall that Barrette finally returned to the basin that had caught his eye. He and his partner, Basil Lanthier, climbed into the steep, cedar-crowded gulch with several pack and saddle horses loaded with enough supplies to last them several weeks. Their departure from Frenchtown was not a secret, thus many eyes would be watchful for any indications that their trip was a success.\r\nAnd indeed, they did find gold, on October 9,1869, at the mouth of Cayuse Creek.\r\nOnce word got past Frenchtown, men (there were no women in Cedar this early) poured in from all over the territory, Northern Idaho, the surrounding states and even the West Coast. From Missoula one correspondent to the \u201cNew North-West\u201d wrote, \u201cMissoula has been wild for a week.\u201d The result, he said, was that \u201cHotel keepers, merchants, clerks, idle men and loafers, all are gone\u2026\u201d\r\nThis frantic mob rushing into such an isolated spot presented some very real problems in the way of lack of shelter and food shortages. Packers soon poured into the snow-packed drainage with beans (50 cents a pound), bacon (75 cents a pound) and gumboots ($18 a pair). Housing was of the roughest sort-canvas shelters and brush hovels. The territory\u2019s papers warned the determined stampeders to go \u201cwell clad, blanketed and pursed.\u201d\r\nThe Beer:\r\nTaking beer back to the era of the 1850\u2019s California Gold Rush, the Cayuse Creek Common brings the flavor. The rustic wood aromas (reminiscent of the barn wood in the taproom) of Northern Brewer hops take charge of the nose, while a slight caramel whiff lingers in the background.
