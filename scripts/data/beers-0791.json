In general the style is characterized by a medium body and broad range of color from golden to reddish brown. Sweet maltiness should dominate over clean hop bitterness. The bitterness should not be aggressive or harsh. Malt character should be light-toasted rather than strongly caramel (though a low level of light caramel character is acceptable). Bread or biscuit-like malt character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Hop aroma and flavor should be notable but at low to medium levels. Fruity esters should not be perceived. Diacetyl and chill haze should not be perceived.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 8, "srmMax": "15", "ibuMax": "30", "abvMin": "5.3", "fgMin": "1.012", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:41:38", "fgMax": "1.02", "shortName": "American Oktoberfest", "abvMax": "5.9", "id": 102, "srmMin": "4", "name": "American-Style M\u00e4rzen / Oktoberfest"}, "id": "YL05dZ", "createDate": "2015-05-11 18:15:47", "updateDate": "2015-05-11 18:15:47", "abv": "5.2", "styleId": 102, "ibu": "25", "name": "Paultoberfest"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Kwak is recognisable by its deep bright amber colour and a dense, creamy coloured head.
