We are located by the Southwest corner of 44th Ave. and Wadsworth Blvd.\r\n\r\nOur take on beer is simple \u2013 Use great ingredients and brew for flavor!  Rickoli\u2019s respects the liquid in the glass and wants to help elevate beer to a refined drinking experience. That\u2019s why we use the finest ingredients and brew in a leisurely manner. The beer tells us when it\u2019s ready. We refuse to be a slave to production deadlines.  Wheat Ridge Colorado is a relaxed community just west of Denver with easy access from I-70. Wheat Ridge was one of the few remaining enclaves along the Front Range without a microbrewery. This changed in November 2012!  We are dedicated to providing our local neighborhood with a place to relax and have a pint close to home.\r\n\r\nOur Brew master, Rick Abitbol has been professionally brewing award winning beers along the Front Range for over a decade.  Rick is respectful of beer styles and traditional brewing technique.  And has long been an innovator of style and not afraid to color outside the lines. He was one of the first brewers to explore the Black IPA which has since come to be regarded as a new style in judging guidelines.   We love hops! That\u2019s not to say you won\u2019t find any wonderfully malty creations on tap there are many, but what you will notice is the variety in our hoppy selections.  Be on the lookout for Rick\u2019s special brews!\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re Talking Much Better Beer!  We are pleased to feature a great selection of Gluten Reduced Beer.  All Rickoli\u2019s brews that do not contain wheat are considered gluten reduced.  Making great craft beer more accessible to everyone.\r\n  \r\nOur glass rinsing stations insure a beer clean glass every time! We want you to drink beer not sanitizer!
