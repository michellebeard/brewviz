Well, we here at the Sawdust City Brewing Co., we not only love beer, but we also love what beer can do!  Beer has the unique ability to bring people together.  We love to see people gatherin' together to eat great food, listen to great music or just to simply talk and tell some great stories. \r\nSo along with makin' some fantastic beer, we set about lookin' to create a place where you could do all those things under one roof.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
