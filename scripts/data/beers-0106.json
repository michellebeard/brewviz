George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not.

Amid the clank of modern machinery, a group of workers busy themselves with one of the world's oldest crafts: brewing. At Gizmo Brew Works, this meeting of contemporary technology and ancient know-how produces a tempting slate of small-batch beers. Inside tanks that hold the equivalent of 1,000 pints each, brewers prep favorites including the smooth and sweet Black Stiletto Stout and the complex Palisade Wasp India Pale Ale with the same care that has earned many of their past beers medals at the Carolina Championship of Beer. They also save room for seasonals, carefully adding a sweet caramel flavor and spicy Noble hops to their altbier. These beers and more make frequent appearances in the brewery's taproom, gracing pint glasses for impromptu toasts or filling up growlers for at-home sips. Never ones to shy away from curious guests, brewers also open up their facility for Saturday tours, walking groups through the beer-making process during 30-minute explorations.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-05-01 12:35:51", "mailingListUrl": "http://app.expressemailmarketing.com/Survey.aspx?SFID=161238", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Thu: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Raleigh", "createDate": "2013-05-01 12:36:52", "id": "t98PYN", "streetAddress": "5907 Triangle Drive", "postalCode": "27617", "website": "http://gizmobrewworks.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(919) 782-2099", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.8965383, "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -78.7441045, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Gizmo Brew Works", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:42:27", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ehcJKn/upload_a5TOKH-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ehcJKn/upload_a5TOKH-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ehcJKn/upload_a5TOKH-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ehcJKn/upload_a5TOKH-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ehcJKn/upload_a5TOKH-icon.png"}, "id": "ehcJKn", "name": "Gizmo Brew Works"}], "description": "Beekeeper Honey Wheat exhibits the characteristics of honey sweetness, floral nose, fruity flavors, a hint of clove, with a light body.
