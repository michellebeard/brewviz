The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "30", "categoryId": 3, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "42", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.008", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:25:18", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "American Pale", "abvMax": "5.6", "id": 25, "srmMin": "6", "name": "American-Style Pale Ale"}, "createDate": "2016-04-27 04:08:48", "updateDate": "2016-06-01 18:34:06", "abv": "6", "styleId": 25, "id": "XYYhK2", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "A smooth English-Style Strong Ale with hints of First Gold hops and warm notes of toffee and raisins.

Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer. The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.
