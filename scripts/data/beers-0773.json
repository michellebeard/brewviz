Three years into our project and we\u2019re grateful and amazed that so many people love and support great beer these days.  The fact that we\u2019re still here is a credit to you all.\r\n\r\nBut for the question of primary importance: What is the beer? Well, it\u2019s our Pretty Things barleywine.  Inspired by malted barley, a tribute to the barleycorn.  Yes, it\u2019s simple, but that\u2019s what barleywines are all about.  Ever since brewing in England, Dann has dreamed of making a barley-focused beer using the malts of Yorkshire (and never hesitates to plug his favorite: Thomas Fawcett & Sons).  The American version of a barleywine is normally a sad beer indeed, lots of hops and alcohol but the star of the show is left scratching his chin in the eaves of the theatre.  This is not one of those beers.  The English invented this style and they\u2019re the only ones who know how to make one, save the rare American brewer.\r\n\r\nGive barley a chance and this mysterious little grain can do grand things!\r\n\r\nTo get the density of sugars needed for this sort of beer, we employed \u201cdouble mashing\u201d. The brewhouse that we work on can only get to maybe 18 plato for a single running of wort: but we wanted 27 plato! So we combined two brews by running wort into the kettle and then using it to mash in the second batch. We don\u2019t take credit for this idea.  We\u2019re certain it has been done many, many times before.  But it wasn\u2019t until Will Meyers (the great Cantabridgian Cervecero) brought this method to our attention that we realized we could brew a barleywine of proper gravity\u2026 (he never told us that he hadn\u2019t actually performed this sort of brewing before!). Anyway, it works!!\r\n\r\nExpect an aroma of juicy sultanas, wet wood, green apple, malted milk balls, marzipan and alcohol deliciousness. It\u2019s got a medium body and is a little more spritsy than we\u2019re sure the Brits would like.
