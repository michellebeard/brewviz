This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.\r\n\r\nJoleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nThe barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a \u201cnanobrewery\u201d, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.  In the fall of 2011, a 7-barrel brewhouse with an automatic canning line was put in place for the microbrewery.\r\n\r\nInsane?...No, we're having the time of our lives!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "TKwUTr", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bucyrus", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "streetAddress": "15194 Walnut Grove Drive", "postalCode": "65444", "website": "http://www.pineyriverbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2010", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "417-967-6786", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 37.3208964, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Missouri", "longitude": -92.0165208, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Piney River", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:14:26", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H1ouEw/upload_uSXA9G-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H1ouEw/upload_uSXA9G-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H1ouEw/upload_uSXA9G-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H1ouEw/upload_uSXA9G-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H1ouEw/upload_uSXA9G-icon.png"}, "id": "H1ouEw", "name": "Piney River Brewing Company"}], "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2014-02-27 13:24:45", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 09:54:32", "abv": "10", "styleId": 30, "availableId": 2, "id": "rCsNVR", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.twistedmanzanita.com", "established": "2010", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Twisted Manzanita Ales craft brewery specializing in beers brewed with passion and creativity.

Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma may be evident at extremely low levels. Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused.
