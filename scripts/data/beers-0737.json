In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds.

Over time, as Bob became more interested in cider, we started traveling to the Pays D\u2019Auge region of Normandy, where we tasted many varieties of this traditional beverage that is typically served with meals, and is the perfect complement to the wonderful cuisine of the area.\r\nAs we experienced the cider culture of northern France, we realized that nothing like these dry, complex ciders existed in the U.S., and we became excited about the prospect of introducing a French-style cider to the American palate. Back at our orchard, we began planting cider cultivars from France, England and America, while testing the types that would work best with the Island\u2019s climate and rocky limestone soil. Our Washington Island orchard has expanded with our passion for cider, and we now produce several varieties of gluten-free cider in our Cider House in the small town of Ellison Bay, WI, located at the tip of the Door Peninsula.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-08-01 14:09:54", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "SPRING (5/1\u20135/24)\r\nFri: 2-5 pm\r\nSat: 12-5 pm\r\nSun: 12-3 pm\r\nOpen Memorial Day 5/25:\r\n12-3 pm\r\n\r\nSUMMER (5/29\u20139/14)\r\nDaily: 12-6 pm\r\n\r\nFALL (9/17\u201310/26)\r\nThurs: 12-4 pm\r\nFri/Sat. : 12-6 pm\r\nSun/Mon: 12-3 pm\r\n\r\nWINTER (10/30\u201311/28)\r\nFri: 2-6 pm\r\nSat: 12-5 pm\r\nSun: Closed", "locationTypeDisplay": "Cidery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ellison Bay", "createDate": "2015-08-01 14:13:52", "id": "l9BVLi", "streetAddress": "12040 Garrett Bay Rd", "postalCode": "54210", "website": "http://islandorchardcider.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(920) 854-3344", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Cidery", "latitude": 45.2563309, "locationType": "cidery", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -87.0712481, "updateDate": "2015-08-01 14:13:52", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Island Orchard Cider", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:14:21", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yy3cTm/upload_1kRAgF-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yy3cTm/upload_1kRAgF-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yy3cTm/upload_1kRAgF-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yy3cTm/upload_1kRAgF-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yy3cTm/upload_1kRAgF-icon.png"}, "id": "yy3cTm", "name": "Island Orchard Cider"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 12, "name": "Mead, Cider, & Perry"}, "ogMin": "1.05", "description": "Generally dry, full-bodied, austere.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ogMax": "1.075", "categoryId": 12, "abvMin": "6", "fgMin": "0.995", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:48:47", "fgMax": "1.01", "shortName": "English Cider", "abvMax": "9", "id": 150, "name": "English Cider"}, "foodPairings": "Pairs well with Paella or spicy seafood stew, pizza, smoked chicken, Hungarian Goulash and BBQ.", "createDate": "2015-08-01 14:18:08", "updateDate": "2015-08-01 14:18:08", "abv": "6.9", "styleId": 150, "id": "OqUTaE", "name": "Oak Aged Apple Cider"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available at the same time of year, every year.", "id": 4, "name": "Seasonal"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "I don't know where to start with this one.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
