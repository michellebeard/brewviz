As businesses continue to evolve and change in Raleigh, we wanted to bring that feeling to the local restaurant scene by offering items that no one else does.  The self-serve beer wall, The Downpour, allow patrons to sample, select, and pour their own beer.  We are importing beers from both Europe and across America to supplement our soon to be released beer line.  A collaborative effort of Matt MacNeil and Adam Hoffman, the goals of the company are simple: Great Beer, Great Food, and Great Service.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Historic CP&L Garage, the space has been renovated to bring back the industrial feel that the Powerhouse Square District deserves.  With garage doors that connect the patio to the restaurant, exposed columns, and I-beams, as well as a custom concrete bar with reclaimed wood accents, we\u2019ve blended the modern with the historic.  The industrial atmosphere has been infused with technology wherever possible. Wi-Fi tablets for tableside service, LED lighting, and of course The Downpour (our self-serve beer wall), all come together to create a space that feels both raw and unfinished, yet modern and  functional.  Come enjoy a drink with friends, cheer your favorite team to victory, or host a company event.\r\n\r\nA bar and restaurant focused on craft beer, Clouds Brewing is home to The Downpour; using RFID technology you can start a tab and pour your own beer. And the best part is you pay by the ounce, not by the pint! Feel free to try a small taste of each beer, or a pint of your favorite\u2014the choice is yours. With 10 rotating taps there is always something new to try, and with no need to buy whole pints, you can try them all! So seriously, come on down, grab a glass, and \u201cExperience the Downpour!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur bar features 40 beers on draft with 10 of those located on The Downpour.

A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
