The most important aspect for us is that we keep our traditional heritage. As we know the saying \"New is not in comparison with the word better\".\r\n\r\nThe Schlossbrauerei Au-Halltertau respects the tradition and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally. The first documented brew master was the royal court brew master named \"Schweiger\" in 1590. At that time the Noble Freiherr Baron von Thurn was the lord of the castle. He was the fourth noble lord since 990 a.d through 1281 a.d that ruled in Au Hallertau.\r\n\r\nSince 1846 the Noble rulers and Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz have ruled and resided in the magnificent \"Moated Castle\" in Au i.d. Hallertau.\r\n\r\nThe noble family of Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz is still living in the castle an in the meantime it is the 6th generation.\r\n\r\nAt present Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz is making sure that the Castle Brewery stays a traditional brewery together with the necessary vision into the future to create a sustainable traditional premium quality future.\r\n\r\nMichael Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz\u2019s utmost desire is not to miss a successful sustainable future and at the same time to keep up the 6 generations of writing a successful historical event for the Castle brewery and it history.\r\n\r\nThe Brew Master Mr. Stefan Ebensperger is supporting the Baron with his highly qualified experience and skills. The necessary emotions and bindings towards a brewing heritage that has been passed down for generations is needed. Tradition is naturally one of the highest priorities for Mr. Ebensperger due to our traditional purity laws dating back to 1516 a.d therefore you can be assured that the quality is a premium German and he says, \"It will also stay like that\". Since 1516 the Bavarians have known how important the quality of the ingredients and the brewing process actually are. Beer was known during the Middle Ages as the same significant value as bread. As a part of the staple die, it was also germ free and full of healthy calories. During that time the average citizen spent a good 20 percent of their income on beer.\r\n\r\nOn the 23. April 1516 the Bavaria Duke Wilhelm IV. Executed and introduced the famous Bavarian Purity law into the Bavarian Parliament in Ingolstadt with the famous words: \"Just like beer in Summer an in winter as well as the county or province it is brewed or served\" Since that day it is prohibited to brew beer for the German market with anything else apart from hops, malt, water and yeast. In 1918 the Weimarer Republik accepted the Bavarian purity law into its republic, therefore the Bavarian purity then became a German law. Under the purity law or Bavaria and Germany the Castle Brewery, inspects, insures and stores all its quality premium beers as in the past historical way the Castle Lords and Brew Masters did.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "vPPBkD", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Au in der Hallertau", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "streetAddress": "Schlossbr\u00e4ugasse 2", "postalCode": "84072", "website": "http://www.auer-bier.de/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1590", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "phone": "+49 / 87 52 / 86 32", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 48.558307, "locationType": "micro", "longitude": 11.741228, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Schlossbrauerei Au-Hallertau", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:26:59", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_3mRY8z-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_3mRY8z-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_3mRY8z-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_3mRY8z-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_3mRY8z-icon.png"}, "id": "HJTHzW", "name": "Schlossbrauerei Au-Hallertau"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 4, "name": "German Origin Ales"}, "description": "These beers are unfiltered German-style Altbier and K\u00f6lsch.

Three of us had sustained minor injuries from the hard landing and required some medical attention. We were helped by some local villagers to a small monastery about a mile from where we landed. There we happened upon a freaky little friar named Fritz. While we were being cared after, Fritz told us his life story, being abandoned by his mother(a magical Pixie) and his father( a wayward Trappist Monk name La Salle who left the ministry and beer making to become an explorer). He was orphaned and left at the monastery to be raised by monks. The years pass by and Fritz learned the art of making \ufb01ne Belgium beers. And, as is the tradition with monks, Fritz loved sharing his incredible beers with us, the needy.\r\n\r\nOne night while drinking quite heavily, Fritz con\ufb01ded to us that his passion for beer and his lack of discipline would always keep him from rising in the ranks at the church, and that his naughty nature would keep him from ever being Head Brewmaster at the monastery. So the four of us decided to open a Brewery back in America and that we would call it the, \" Naughty Monk Brewery\". We brought Fritz with us, and we keep him hidden in the brewery, and here he brews beer, creates recipes, stalks the female employees and loves to play practical jokes on everyone. So keep a close eye out!

Three of us had sustained minor injuries from the hard landing and required some medical attention. We were helped by some local villagers to a small monastery about a mile from where we landed. There we happened upon a freaky little friar named Fritz. While we were being cared after, Fritz told us his life story, being abandoned by his mother(a magical Pixie) and his father( a wayward Trappist Monk name La Salle who left the ministry and beer making to become an explorer). He was orphaned and left at the monastery to be raised by monks. The years pass by and Fritz learned the art of making \ufb01ne Belgium beers. And, as is the tradition with monks, Fritz loved sharing his incredible beers with us, the needy.\r\n\r\nOne night while drinking quite heavily, Fritz con\ufb01ded to us that his passion for beer and his lack of discipline would always keep him from rising in the ranks at the church, and that his naughty nature would keep him from ever being Head Brewmaster at the monastery. So the four of us decided to open a Brewery back in America and that we would call it the, \" Naughty Monk Brewery\". We brought Fritz with us, and we keep him hidden in the brewery, and here he brews beer, creates recipes, stalks the female employees and loves to play practical jokes on everyone.

He was orphaned and left at the monastery to be raised by monks. The years pass by and Fritz learned the art of making \ufb01ne Belgium beers. And, as is the tradition with monks, Fritz loved sharing his incredible beers with us, the needy.\r\n\r\nOne night while drinking quite heavily, Fritz con\ufb01ded to us that his passion for beer and his lack of discipline would always keep him from rising in the ranks at the church, and that his naughty nature would keep him from ever being Head Brewmaster at the monastery. So the four of us decided to open a Brewery back in America and that we would call it the, \" Naughty Monk Brewery\". We brought Fritz with us, and we keep him hidden in the brewery, and here he brews beer, creates recipes, stalks the female employees and loves to play practical jokes on everyone.

Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).
