In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard.

The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast.

Ours is a \"brewers' brewery\", with an uncompromising focus on beer quality.\r\n\r\n From the beginning, our goal was to make beers that we liked to drink. All of our beers are served up unfiltered and long-aged, to deliver maximum flavor and character. The beers can be very complex and assertive, but with the ultimate goal of proper balance. We aim to satisfy both the hardcore aficionados and the more casual craft beer fan, all in the same glass.\r\n\r\n In June of 2013, Matt purchased Charlie's shares of Double Mountain, vowing to continue the good work the two partners created.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:53", "mailingListUrl": "http://visitor.constantcontact.com/manage/optin/ea?v=001nxNUBQroFr3hjq6FYVwFkkyCOBhaGExXaxrZhqC8w77l41A-A2WhADmLcObiDpQkWRv_aW3ZWsS2PPug8oPv5xCH8VvV78Ga", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "4kMvnC", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Hood River", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:53", "streetAddress": "8 Fourth Street", "postalCode": "97031", "website": "http://www.doublemountainbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "541-387-0042", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 45.7099797, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -121.5144842, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Double Mountain", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:44:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WxtiJC/upload_AT3wnf-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WxtiJC/upload_AT3wnf-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WxtiJC/upload_AT3wnf-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WxtiJC/upload_AT3wnf-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WxtiJC/upload_AT3wnf-icon.png"}, "id": "WxtiJC", "name": "Double Mountain Brewery"}], "description": "Open the Fourth Seal and partake in the luminous pungency of dank tropical forest.

It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent malted wheat. Fruit or fruit extracts contribute flavor and/or aroma. Perceived fruit qualities should be authentic and replicate true fruit complexity as much as possible. Color should reflect a degree of fruit's color. Hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor from yeast can be typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clovelike characteristics should not be perceived. Body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. When this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.
