The story has it that a great white Yeti (Abominator), while passing through town, loved what he saw and decided to stay for a bit. While cuddling up to Dayton one night he unwittingly put the city into a deep freeze. It wasn't until weeks later that he figured out he was the reason the city was frozen solid.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe knew then, that he had to say goodbye to the friendly town so things could return to normal. But before moving on, he left a small batch of Doppelbock beer behind to say thanks to the people of Dayton. Later, that beer became his namesake.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt's said that if not for the warming effects of that hearty lager bestowed on us by The Abominator in that fateful winter of 1978, our city may have remained frozen forever. Thanks A-man.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis German style lager is chestnut brown in color with hints of red and aromas that are slightly nutty, bread-like with warming hints of caramel. The malt character, like the aroma is nutty and bready with a mild sweetness throughout the body and finish that is reminiscent of caramel.
