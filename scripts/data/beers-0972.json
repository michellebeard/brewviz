Sara had just finished her fifth season of guiding whitewater rafting trips and Jordan had recently passed the Colorado Bar exam. People scoffed. However, for Sara and Jordan the next logical step was to open up a cool wing joint where people could drink cold beer, eat spicy wings, listen to some good music and kick it with their homies. They wanted to open their wing joint in a town that needed great wings and that suited their outdoorsy lifestyles.\r\nAfter some research it became clear that Portland was the ideal place. After moving to Oregon in the fall of 2003, Sara and Jordan scoped out the town, worked hard in local restaurants, and developed their menu for their new restaurant. Neither of them had ever managed a restaurant, let alone owned one. They attended small business meetings, talked to accountants, restaurant owners and local wing connoisseurs. People asked them if Portland was ready for a wing joint. Others suggested they should have stuck with their previous occupations. The naysayers fueled Sara and Jordan's passion for opening their restaurant even more.\r\nOn the first day of 2005, the first customers walked through the doors of Fire on the Mountain Buffalo Wings. In the early days, there were just a couple cooks and Sara and Jordan were the only front of house staff. Fast forward to 2011 where Fire on the Mountain Buffalo Wings has become a Portland institution with three restaurants and close to 100 employees. FOTM still possesses the same passion to provide customers with a fun, easygoing restaurant to enjoy our delicious food and great service.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-05-20 23:32:06", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun:  11:00am - 12:00am\nMon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Portland", "createDate": "2015-05-26 16:19:11", "id": "zXqAje", "streetAddress": "1708 E.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
