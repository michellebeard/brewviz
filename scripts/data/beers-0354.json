After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery. Live music and dancing will also be a regular nighttime happening at the brewpub consisting of mostly local bands playing cover type and original Rock, Blues, Jazz and Reggae.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:53", "mailingListUrl": "info@eltorobrewing.com", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "4F7QA9", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Morgan Hill", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:53", "streetAddress": "17605 Monterey Road", "postalCode": "95037", "website": "http://www.eltorobrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "408-782-2739", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 37.1304557, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -121.6546846, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "El Toro", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:45:15", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yuxw75/upload_Idq3L2-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yuxw75/upload_Idq3L2-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yuxw75/upload_Idq3L2-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yuxw75/upload_Idq3L2-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yuxw75/upload_Idq3L2-icon.png"}, "id": "yuxw75", "name": "El Toro Brewing Company"}], "originalGravity": "1.096", "createDate": "2015-03-25 16:07:03", "updateDate": "2015-03-25 16:07:03", "abv": "10", "styleId": 31, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.075", "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-05-07 17:45:28", "locations": [{"website": "http://brewage.at/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "1060 Wien", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2016-05-07 17:50:12", "countryIsoCode": "AT", "longitude": 16.3434939, "hoursOfOperation": "Tue:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nWed:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nThu:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n", "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+43 1 9550935", "streetAddress": "Mittelgasse 4", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-05-07 17:50:12", "country": {"displayName": "Austria", "name": "AUSTRIA", "isoThree": "AUT", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 40, "isoCode": "AT"}, "latitude": 48.1939642, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "mMnrjZ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brew Age", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-05-07 18:30:52", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png"}, "id": "Y2gEyS", "name": "Brew Age"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.
