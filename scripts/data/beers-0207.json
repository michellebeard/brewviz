These will just be a few of the ales we will be offering as we expand into seasonal batches, plus we just started our PRO-AM line of brews where home brewers can compete to have their recipe produced at our brewery(with the help of the creators if they desire). The winning entry will also be entered into the GABF. \r\n\r\nThanks to the help of our five distributors, we are able to get our brews to a variety of locations(including grocery stores, beverage shops, pubs and restaurants) throughout Texas and a few other states including Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and South Carolina.

Despite what the weighty aroma suggests, Burnt Rock has a good, clean finish, and sessionable drinkability.\r\nHistory & Style\r\n\r\nBurnt Rock was brewed first in 2012, as part of our Pro-Am Series of beers designed by amateur brewers and brewed at Beau\u2019s \u2013 cheers to its creator, Patrick Boisvenue! The 2013 edition of Burnt Rock Vanilla Porter won Gold at Montreal\u2019s Mondial de la Bi\u00e8re.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes\r\n\r\nWith rich, luxuriant vanilla aromas reminiscent of fine pipe tobacco, selected dark malts offer up balancing chocolate and coffee nuances for this medium-bodied beer. Hops add a pleasantly dry finish.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Burnt Rock", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/MY5aX7/upload_00S4KU-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/MY5aX7/upload_00S4KU-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/MY5aX7/upload_00S4KU-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.054", "id": "MY5aX7", "servingTemperature": "cold", "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cold - (4-7C/39-45F)", "createDate": "2015-03-01 19:30:27", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 23:13:26", "abv": "5.6", "styleId": 18, "availableId": 2, "foodPairings": "Fair trade 70% chocolate, or gingerbread", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
