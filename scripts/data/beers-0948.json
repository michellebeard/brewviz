Medium to high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma should be evident. This medium-bodied pale ale has low to medium malt flavor and aroma. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to strong. Chill haze may be in evidence only at very cold temperatures. The absence of diacetyl is desirable, though, diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "5", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.008", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:18:23", "fgMax": "1.016", "shortName": "English Pale", "abvMax": "5.5", "id": 1, "srmMin": "5", "name": "Classic English-Style Pale Ale"}, "createDate": "2013-11-12 01:12:08", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 06:25:26", "abv": "4.2", "styleId": 1, "id": "CvUkQA", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available at the same time of year, every year.", "id": 4, "name": "Seasonal"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Ebony in color with a rich creamy head, earthy flavor and a mellow, chocolate finish.\r\n\r\nThis is a beer equally at home with oysters as it is with a homemade pizza and freshly tossed green salad (or as a float over ice cream).", "srmId": 41, "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "nameDisplay": "Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PpNk6z/upload_g842sL-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PpNk6z/upload_g842sL-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PpNk6z/upload_g842sL-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.038", "description": "Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present.
