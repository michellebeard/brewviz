The cider brandy flavours naturally combine beautifully with the apple flavours in the beer and the farmyard brettanomyces character in the beer has become more dominant.

We bought the barrels with this beer in mind, as soon as we opened them up the aroma that hit us screamed barley wine at us.

The big flavours and warming alcohol make this the perfect winter beer. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhiskebeest - a year ago we put 2 barrels worth of Wildebeest in Whisky barrels - it was all we could spare.
