We are an artisinal nano-brewery in the city of Carpinteria, CA that focuses on creating small batch beers with an experimental approach. Rob and Steve met in 1999 and brewed their first batch of beer together in 2008. While attending UCSB, Rob met Peter while visiting Orella Ranch in Gaviota and they began brewing beer together in the Santa Barbara area. Then, in the summer of 2011, the three of them converged for a backpacking trip (pictured above) on The Lost Coast of Northern California - it was on this trip that they first discussed starting a brewery together. In late 2012 after some serious brainstorming and long meetings, the initiative had begun and planning was underway.\r\n \r\nIt is vitally important to us that we are directly involved with the production of our raw materials.  We are growing our own hops in the Santa Barbara area to supplement our usage, and in the future we plan to be growing enough to supply hops to the local community.  Our grains will be grown in the Santa Ynez Valley and malted right here in Santa Barbara.  All of our solid waste (spent grains, hops, yeast) will be fed to local pigs, local cricket farmers, or composted .  We will participate in, and contribute to, local festivals and events that revolve around brewing, environmentalism, and the promotion of local businesses.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-04-06 17:17:38", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Fri:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Carpinteria", "createDate": "2015-04-07 19:22:22", "id": "9Hqlzg", "streetAddress": "4191-8 Carpinteria Ave.", "postalCode": "93013", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "949.922.9152", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 34.4037704, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -119.5337568, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 19:22:22", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "brewLAB", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:07:16", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DFJoPF/upload_AttrGR-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DFJoPF/upload_AttrGR-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DFJoPF/upload_AttrGR-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DFJoPF/upload_AttrGR-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DFJoPF/upload_AttrGR-icon.png"}, "id": "DFJoPF", "name": "brewLAB"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.064", "description": "Belgian dark strong ales are amber to dark brown in color.
