They soon found another shared interest--experiencing the world of beer. The two made many friends spending spare evenings in New England pubs offering European beers, which, before the emergence of American craft beers, were the best beers available. The two often discussed their dream of opening their own brewery over the years. In August of 2012, John and Dan decided to take the keg into their own hands, and ENKI Brewing Company was born. Just a few months later, their dreams came to fruition at 7929 Victoria Drive.
