We used the hops in the boil and also dry hopped for a full week. The aroma of this brew is all tropical fruit with a nice balanced flavor. The bitterness is subdued by the flavor of the hop itself. The body is nice and thin, perfect for a day out on the boat fishing or playing some golf. Instead of making all big, high gravity beers during winter, we wanted to make a lighter brew with great flavor and aroma for the Miami weather.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "El Dorado Pale Ale", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
