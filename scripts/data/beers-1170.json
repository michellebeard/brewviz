Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:27", "shortName": "BBL Aged", "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "createDate": "2016-03-20 04:51:10", "updateDate": "2016-03-22 18:52:41", "abv": "13.8", "styleId": 132, "id": "8hWZvG", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "name": "XLCR", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "XLCR", "originalGravity": "1.061", "id": "F05XkN", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-07-05 14:21:59", "updateDate": "2014-10-21 14:56:37", "abv": "4", "styleId": 25, "availableId": 1, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
