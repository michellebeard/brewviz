We will strive to be a gathering place for beer lovers and support bicycling as a great way to get around our beautiful city.\r\n\r\nPeddler Brewing Company has a 7-barrel brewing system which means it can pump out up to 14 kegs of beer per batch. We plan to have 8 taps in our tap room with a few regular taps and a couple rotating seasonal taps. We also plan to have a guest tap or two of other WA state brews or ciders. Our indoor space will have a large bar and tables for guests to sit back and enjoy a taster tray or a pint. We will also have a growler and 32oz bottle exchange to take beer home, with a small deposit encouraging the return and re-use of bottles/growlers.\r\n\r\nDecide to ride your bike to our brewery? Perfect! We have an indoor bike rack that holds 9 bicycles and will have a bike work station for you to do some tune-ups, pump up your tire, or easily fix that flat.
