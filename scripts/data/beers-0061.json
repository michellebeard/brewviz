Rather than solely using European-style tart and bitter apples, Blue Toad Hard Cider uses a cider blend of three different apples (replete with natural seasonal variation) grown and pressed at Schutt\u2019s Apple Mill in Webster, New York, which has been producing some of New York\u2019s finest sweet cider since 1918. The sweeteners we use in our brewing process are also sourced locally, and our production takes place in our cidery at the Genesee Regional Market in Rochester.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

We\u2019re true to the craft because we honor traditions of workmanship perfected by centuries of well-trained hands.\r\n\r\nThe Fidelis Philosophy took root in the fertile soil of Shawnee-On-Delaware, Pennsylvania. Our village, bounded by wooded hills on one side and the Delaware River on the other, enjoys a mild and varied climate, plenty of water and sun, abundant plants and wildlife and friendly, talented people. We are captivated by this nature and its possibilities. And our location- less than 100 miles from both New York City and Philadelphia- makes it only natural for us to broadly share the Fidelis Philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn a world of mass-production, our products are handmade. In a world of homogeneity, our products represent a defiant individuality. In a world without roots, our products embody a tangible sense of place. We aspire to eat what we grow, to drink what we brew, and to build what we use. And we\u2019d like you to experience a taste of this lifestyle yourself- in the form of ShawneeCraft beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Shawnee On Delaware", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "id": "haX4c9", "streetAddress": "1 River Road", "postalCode": "18356", "website": "http://www.shawneecraftbrewingcompany.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(570) 424-0990", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Gem & Keystone", "latitude": 41.008177, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.108645, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tasting Room Hours:\r\nWednesday - Sunday: 12:00 - 5:00 and Thursdays until 10:00\r\n\r\nTours:\r\nWednesday - Sunday: 12:00", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Shawnee On Delaware", "createDate": "2013-08-13 17:01:56", "id": "0nbvfO", "streetAddress": "1 River Road", "postalCode": "18356", "website": "http://www.shawneecraftbrewingcompany.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(570) 213-5151", "isClosed": "N", "name": "ShawneeCraft Brewery", "latitude": 41.008177, "locationType": "tasting", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.108645, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "ShawneeCraft", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:26:08", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vSGcZr/upload_bHMyOR-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vSGcZr/upload_bHMyOR-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vSGcZr/upload_bHMyOR-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vSGcZr/upload_bHMyOR-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vSGcZr/upload_bHMyOR-icon.png"}, "id": "vSGcZr", "name": "ShawneeCraft Brewing Company"}], "description": "Apiarius is not a sweet beer, though it is brewed with a generous charge of honey from our own hives (or from our neighbors\u2019 hives when we run out).

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "35", "categoryId": 9, "srmMax": "40", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "7.5", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:41:46", "fgMax": "1.022", "shortName": "Baltic Porter", "abvMax": "9", "id": 104, "srmMin": "40", "name": "Baltic-Style Porter"}, "createDate": "2015-08-18 23:19:25", "updateDate": "2016-06-23 18:11:29", "abv": "8", "styleId": 104, "id": "e4uTBR", "name": "Apogee"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Apoldaer 1806", "nameDisplay": "Apoldaer 1806", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.vereinsbrauerei-apolda.de/", "established": "1887", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Vereinsbrauerei Apolda", "createDate": "2012-08-07 10:20:41", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.vereinsbrauerei-apolda.de/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 51.022251, "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Th\u00fcringen", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "longitude": 11.512385, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "(3644) 84840", "streetAddress": "Topfmarkt 14 Apolda", "createDate": "2012-08-12 14:45:42", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "postalCode": "99510", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "zGfZjm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Vereinsbrauerei Apolda", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:36:29", "id": "wFAVxU", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.048", "description": "Today's Oktoberfest beers are characterized by a medium body and light, golden color.
