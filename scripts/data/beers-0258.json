Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason\u2019s wedding to his son\u2019s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews.

Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together.
