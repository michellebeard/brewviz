We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange

Hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Scottish heavy ale will have a medium degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

A soft oaken nose and a mellow woodiness on the pallet are an integral element to any beautifully crafted wine or whiskey. So what happens when Silver City brewers take a world class beer like Fat Scotch Ale and age it for over 6 months on American white oak? A completely unique and wonderful beer emerges. The slight peaty, intensely malty scotch ale and the complex vanilla character of the oak meld seamlessly over time to create, what we think is, an exceptionally satisfying beer.\r\n\r\nPeoples Choice Award Washington Cask Ale Festival - 2004 \r\nBronze Medal - North American Beer Festival - 2006", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Fat Woody Scotch Ale", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.silvercitybrewery.com/", "established": "1996", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Steve and I got into business together in 1990 when we opened our first restaurant, Top Notch Burger, in East Bremerton. We operated with a menu of fresh, made-to-order hamburgers, fresh cut French Fries and real ice cream shakes. Our 2nd location was here at our Silverdale location. We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger.
