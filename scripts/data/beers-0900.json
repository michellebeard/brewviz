The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers.

Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to \"550 degrees\"? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That\u2019s what craft beer is\u2026a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well\u2026..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.\r\n\r\nOnce NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik\u2019s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park\u2019s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers. We should all thank our lucky stars that we live in a state with such high quality Breweries.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-07-25 13:35:25", "locations": [{"website": "http://350Brewing.com", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Tinley Park", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "countryIsoCode": "US", "longitude": -87.7911748, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 41.5593734, "streetAddress": "7144 183rd St", "createDate": "2014-07-25 13:36:01", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-03 19:00:50", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "60477", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "1mRL8J", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "350", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:56:23", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_uohtEs-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_uohtEs-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_uohtEs-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_uohtEs-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_uohtEs-icon.png"}, "id": "W3pb09", "name": "350 Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it\u2019s capacity, and soon Fegley\u2019s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities.

Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use.

Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer.

In January of 2010, with inspired council from family, Paul Coggins relocated to Georgia to focus the group on one purpose.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made.

With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "id": "71LkGn", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.threefloydspub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-219-922-3565", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.535541, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516686, "updateDate": "2015-06-18 14:42:36", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "GoDmMT", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:16", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.3floyds.com/", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "219-922-4425", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Munster", "latitude": 41.535536, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516687, "updateDate": "2015-04-01 18:55:51", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Three Floyds", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-07-29 12:02:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-icon.png"}, "id": "iodDki", "name": "Three Floyds Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment.
