No diacetyl should be perceived.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "15", "categoryId": 4, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.9", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:30:15", "fgMax": "1.028", "shortName": "Weizenbock", "abvMax": "9.3", "id": 53, "srmMin": "5", "name": "South German-Style Weizenbock / Weissbock"}, "createDate": "2014-07-17 19:49:43", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 15:29:13", "abv": "10", "styleId": 53, "id": "PIBnmU", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}]
