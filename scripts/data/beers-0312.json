They met in September 2002 in the tiny Scottish village of St. Andrews, Scotland. Bailey was a Harvard student doing a semester abroad and Robyn was beginning undergrad at St. Andrews. They bonded over being put into the worst dorm for overseas orientation and teaching Danish people how to play beer pong. Though after three months Bailey went back to Cambridge, you can't break the bonds that are made when teaching Europeans drinking games and a true friendship was born. During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:58", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Nashville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:58", "id": "Syl46S", "streetAddress": "701 8th Avenue South", "postalCode": "37203", "website": "http://www.jackalopebrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "857-998-2571", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 36.1503749, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Tennessee", "longitude": -86.779494, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Jackalope", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:04:10", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p1tFbP/upload_FgvJzY-icon.png"}, "id": "p1tFbP", "name": "Jackalope Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

The Saratoga Resort and Spa consistently draws people from all over Colorado and Wyoming due to its unique offering of a variety of amenities in one location--such as an on-site brewery, mineral hot spring pools, great food, western-styled rooms, jeep, ATV and snowmobile rentals, a golf course and a full-service spa.  \r\n\r\nThe Snowy Mountain Brewery is gaining in exposure and was featured recently in Travel Pulse\u2019s \u201c5 Unique Beer Vacation Spots in the U.S.!\u201d  The name Snowy Mountain is fitting for the brewery as it sits adjacent the majestic Snowy Range Mountains, in southern Wyoming. Boasting 8-10 different craft beers throughout each season, the Snowy Mountain Brewery is one of the fastest growing breweries in Wyoming and surrounding states. The famous brewpub, with a throw-back to the wild west, is adorned with big game mounts and bar-stools made with six-shooters and patinated saddles and features a full pub menu with selections that compliment Saratoga's finest craft beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Hours: 11am to Close, Daily", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Saratoga", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "id": "6txGoK", "streetAddress": "601 Pic Pike Rd", "postalCode": "82331", "extendedAddress": "PO Box 869", "website": "http://www.saratogaresortandspa.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "307-326-5261", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Snowy Mountain Pub & Brewery", "latitude": 41.4529922, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Wyoming", "longitude": -106.8015215, "updateDate": "2015-06-04 18:45:46", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Snowy Mountain", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:26:24", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_Ayx34n-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_Ayx34n-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_Ayx34n-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_Ayx34n-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_Ayx34n-icon.png"}, "id": "u8Rbm0", "name": "Snowy Mountain Brewery"}], "ibu": "40.7", "servingTemperature": "cold", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 18:15:17", "createDate": "2014-09-15 20:53:56"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.dirtybucketbrewery.com/", "established": "2012", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Dirty Bucket Brewing Co. started over exactly that...a dirty bucket.
