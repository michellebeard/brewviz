The use of American hops, particularly Cascade, lend citrusy grapefruit character to the beer. American hops also have a very floral aroma.\r\n\r\nTasting notes:\r\nAppearance: Clear copper color with a white head.\r\nAroma: Floral citrusy hop aroma\r\nTaste: Citrus and resinous pine balanced by toasted, bready malts. Good amount of bittering, but certainly not over the top; strong dry hop character.\r\nMouth feel: Medium body and good mouth feel that holds to the end\r\nFinish: Noticeably bitter finish\r\nOverall: This is an aggressively hopped beer; a hop heads dream while providing enough malt to not disappoint.", "srmId": 11, "nameDisplay": "A.P.A", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/rBuo01/upload_0CxH7j-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/rBuo01/upload_0CxH7j-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/rBuo01/upload_0CxH7j-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.049", "id": "rBuo01", "servingTemperature": "cold", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cold - (4-7C/39-45F)", "createDate": "2014-09-10 03:41:33", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 16:16:20", "abv": "5.3", "styleId": 25, "availableId": 1, "srm": {"hex": "D77200", "id": 11, "name": "11"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
