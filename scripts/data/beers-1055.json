We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Tasting Room & Store Hours\r\nMonday-Friday, 11:00-7:00\r\nSaturday-Sunday, 10:00-5:00", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "id": "PckBjw", "streetAddress": "5401 Linda Vista Road", "postalCode": "92110", "extendedAddress": "#406", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(619) 295-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Home Brew Mart", "latitude": 32.7667586, "locationType": "tasting", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1952129, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:33:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "a7VHpi", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2012-12-07 00:05:42", "streetAddress": "10051 Old Grove Rd", "postalCode": "92131", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(858) 695-2739", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Scripps Ranch Brewery", "latitude": 32.898466, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.110794, "updateDate": "2015-06-11 14:39:57", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:03:59", "id": "cLcfTf", "streetAddress": "2215 India St", "postalCode": "92101", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(619) 255-7213", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Tasting Room & Kitchen", "latitude": 32.7277143, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1697202, "updateDate": "2015-06-11 13:48:56", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "1zYgG4", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2015-06-09 16:08:18", "streetAddress": "9045 Carroll Way", "postalCode": "92121", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2014", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "8587906900", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Miramar", "latitude": 32.8881618, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1580141, "updateDate": "2016-09-20 15:35:53", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon\u2013Sat 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSunday 11:00am\u20139:00pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2015-06-09 20:31:45", "id": "gRg0OA", "streetAddress": "9045 Carroll Way", "postalCode": "92121", "website": "www.ballastpoint.com", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "8587906900", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 32.8881618, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1580141, "updateDate": "2015-06-16 14:59:48", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "kr3KqQ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Long Beach", "createDate": "2016-06-21 19:31:36", "streetAddress": "110 N.

The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA.   David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments.  David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.  David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory.  Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery.                   \r\n\r\nWith the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens.  The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over.  Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.  One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings.  The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece.  We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer.  Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.  Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice.   We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.  Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have  20+ years of experience.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life.   Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort.  Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.  Creature Comforts is the end result of the story of our past and the starting point for the story our future, and we look forward to writing that story with you.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-11-07 00:01:58", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tue:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 4:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Athens", "createDate": "2014-11-13 18:35:40", "id": "r9KC4e", "streetAddress": "271 W.

It was getting dark and he decided to take a shortcut through the woods in order to reach his hotel in the city before nightfall. As the sun set, he found himself in the middle of the dark woods. He camped for the evening and made a fire. As he settled in, he noticed a light approaching from the depths of the forest. He took shelter to avoid being seen by potential thieves. A dark figure emerged from the woods carrying a large black cauldron and a heavy burlap sack. The figure placed the cauldron over the fire and added strange substances to the pot. Soon, an enticing chocolate aroma permeated the campsite and the hiding traveler became more intrigued but was still afraid to be seen. Suddenly, the figure reached into the burlap sack and tossed mysterious pinecone-shaped vegetation into the cauldron, which began to froth excitedly, emitting aromas of molasses and blackberry. The figure leaned over the kettle and inhaled deeply, enjoying the boiling concoction. Finally, he raised his hands and uttered an other-wordly incantation in a disconnected language that the man could not identify. Tree limbs levitated from the dark woods and into the pot, stirring and infusing with the dark liquid inside. Suddenly there was a brilliant flash of light and the traveler lost consciousness. He awoke as the sun was rising across the sky and small beams of light permeated the forest. The dark figure was gone and all that was left was a strange urn resting by the campsite.

Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present.
