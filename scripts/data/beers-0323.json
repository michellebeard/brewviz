With a 15 barrel system and a restaurant that compliments the fine hand crafted beer, Hop Valley has grown into one of Springfield's largest businesses.  Distributing beer throughout the Western States.\r\nBased on that success, and significant pent up demand for their beer, Hop Valley opened a new facility at 990 W.1st Ave in Eugene at which they have built a new, much larger, 60 barrel production brewery.  This facility will be capable of producing up to 100,000 barrels per year, in stark contrast to the system in Springfield, that is maxed out at about 4000 barrels produced in 2012.\r\nOur state of the art equipment and the facility are all built with every opportunity toward a green foot print, including the most efficient lighting, boiler, solar heating, etc.. available today.\r\nThe new facility has a large tasting room and outdoor patio and also has limited food service, to allow customers to enjoy all of our craft brews in a very comfortable setting, and with enough parking and outdoor area to support large parties!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:58", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Springfield", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:58", "id": "dqfA53", "streetAddress": "980 Kruse Way", "postalCode": "97477", "website": "http://www.hopvalleybrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(541) 744-3330", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.082956, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -123.039863, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "11:30am-10:00pm Sunday-Wednesday\r\n11:30am-11:00pm Thursday-Saturday", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Eugene", "createDate": "2013-08-13 00:51:08", "id": "OTt7Vx", "streetAddress": "990 W.1st Ave", "postalCode": "97402", "website": "http://www.hopvalleybrewing.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "541-485-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Hop Valley Brewing Co.", "latitude": 44.05819, "locationType": "production", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -123.107531, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Hop Valley", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:15:36", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8IJKF0/upload_DhZACn-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8IJKF0/upload_DhZACn-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8IJKF0/upload_DhZACn-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8IJKF0/upload_DhZACn-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8IJKF0/upload_DhZACn-icon.png"}, "id": "8IJKF0", "name": "Hop Valley Brewing Co."}], "description": "This golden colored ale pours with a rich white head.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm).

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.
