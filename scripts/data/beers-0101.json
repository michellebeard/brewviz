Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:11", "mailingListUrl": "http://www.troegs.com/about_us/newsletter.aspx", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Hershey", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:11", "id": "C6iHOv", "streetAddress": "200 E Hersheypark Dr", "postalCode": "17033", "website": "http://www.troegs.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "717-232-1297", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 40.2972852, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -76.6428527, "updateDate": "2015-04-24 16:00:33", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Tr\u00f6egs", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:01:05", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_d9lSk3-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png"}, "id": "n5QFi2", "name": "Tr\u00f6egs Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 8, "name": "North American Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars.
