To this day, Widmer Brothers continues to create handcrafted beers with a unique and unconventional twist on traditional styles that are award winning and please a wide range of craft beer lovers.\r\n\r\nRedhook began in a Seattle transmission shop in 1981, and those colorful roots are reflected in the brand\u2019s personality to this day. As one of the country\u2019s first craft breweries, Redhook continues to offer sessionable craft beers to consumers across the country.\r\n\r\nKona Brewing was founded in 1994 by the father and son team of Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who dreamed of crafting fresh, local island brews with spirit, passion and quality.
