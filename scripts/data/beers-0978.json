While these beers were historically very different from one another depending on where they were brewed, modern Saisons are typically modeled after the Saison Dupont, brewed by Brasserie Dupont in Belgium, which gets its unique flavor from a special yeast strain. Soleil has a characteristic spicy/fruity ester profile resulting from our special yeast strain and a small amount of dry hopping. The extraordinarily attenuative yeast gives a beer with a dry finish and silky mouthfeel.
