At first the only thing we had in common was the desire to build something to be proud of, something that made the world a better, more engaging place. Jason\u2019s passion for cider is what brought us together. And the world is obviously a better place with good cider.\r\n\r\nJason, like other members of the team, fell in love with cider during his time spent studying abroad in London. He returned to the States and found himself let down with the selection available. Armed with some family cider making history from English cider country, Jason audaciously convinced our professor to let him start an alcohol company and pitch it to the class. We all were crazy enough to join him and have been trying to mange his risk taking and big ideas ever since.\r\n\r\nWe started out in our basement, experimenting first with store bought juice then with juice from across Minnesota and from across the country. After many obstacles, emergency meetings, late nights, bad batches, lessons from mentors and fun nights of \u201cresearch\u201d, we had a cider that we loved and a plan to bring it to market.\r\n\r\nLionheart was born from a opportunity to turn our passion from a class project into a business and we ran with it. In the spring of 2015 we partnered with a Jester and Judge Cider Company of Stevenson, Washington to produce our first commercial batch. Four-packs Lionheart Original hit store shelves on July 14th, 2015. We\u2019re now starting to work towards building a cidery and taproom here in the Twin Cities; Lionheart is Minnesota born and we can\u2019t wait for it to be Minnesota made.\r\n\r\nLionheart by definition means courageous. We believe it takes a lionhearted person to make their way throughout the world, figure out who they want to be, and what kind of mark they want to leave on this place. We hope that Lionheart encourages people to do just that, to get out of their everyday, meet new people, try new things and share different experiences, all with a great cider in hand.\r\n\r\nWe believe that great craft cider is like great craft beer: made by real people who use hard work and creativity to make products they love.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-09-01 15:42:08", "mailingListUrl": "info@lionheartcider.com", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Cidery", "locality": "Minneapolis", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Minnesota", "longitude": -93.2650108, "isClosed": "N", "createDate": "2016-09-01 15:44:04", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-09-01 15:44:04", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "latitude": 44.977753, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "NPZ5un", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Lionheart Cider", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-09-01 15:47:17", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b2VgxZ/upload_5f4p0r-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b2VgxZ/upload_5f4p0r-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b2VgxZ/upload_5f4p0r-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b2VgxZ/upload_5f4p0r-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b2VgxZ/upload_5f4p0r-icon.png"}, "id": "b2VgxZ", "name": "Lionheart Cider"}], "name": "Original", "nameDisplay": "Original", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vFXvSM/upload_pcyCRj-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vFXvSM/upload_pcyCRj-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vFXvSM/upload_pcyCRj-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 12, "name": "Mead, Cider, & Perry"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Variable, but should be a medium, refreshing drink.
