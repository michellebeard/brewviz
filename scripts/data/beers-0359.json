This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "mailingListUrl": "http://visitor.constantcontact.com/manage/optin?v=001uBxRG66eq3ajbdfZ6GjL91di7O20EmmX", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "jPbb33", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Houston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "streetAddress": "2000 Lyons Avenue", "postalCode": "77020", "website": "http://www.saintarnold.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1994", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "713-686-9494", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 29.7715192, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Texas", "longitude": -95.3484972, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Saint Arnold", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:56:40", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H3UW27/upload_rnr6XH-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H3UW27/upload_rnr6XH-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H3UW27/upload_rnr6XH-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H3UW27/upload_rnr6XH-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/H3UW27/upload_rnr6XH-icon.png"}, "id": "H3UW27", "name": "Saint Arnold Brewing Company"}], "ibu": "76", "servingTemperature": "cool", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 21:05:16", "createDate": "2012-11-04 22:32:25"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The dubbel style originated in Belgium, possibly as a \"second style\" offered for sale by monastic breweries.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.
