While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage \u2014 an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-04-08 13:11:43", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "Zhydrx", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Vista", "createDate": "2014-04-08 13:13:42", "streetAddress": "2545 Progress Street", "postalCode": "92081", "extendedAddress": "Suite D", "website": "http://boozebrothersbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(760) 295-0217", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.148172, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.218047, "updateDate": "2015-08-26 16:23:19", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Booze Brothers", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:53:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-icon.png"}, "id": "xaBLno", "name": "Booze Brothers Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.055", "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:56", "shortName": "BBL Aged Sour", "id": 136, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer"}, "id": "IbYpwM", "createDate": "2015-08-14 17:48:49", "updateDate": "2015-08-14 19:36:14", "abv": "8.4", "styleId": 136, "availableId": 2, "ibu": "30", "name": "Bellwether"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available during the spring months.", "id": 5, "name": "Spring"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.luckybucketbrewing.com/", "established": "2008", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "After years of working a local brewpub and experimenting in the garage, three guys decided to take their know-how and passion for great beer and bottle it.\r\n\r\nLucky Bucket Brewing Company is Nebraska's newest craft brewery, growing almost as fast as we can brew it.

The brewery was established by Hugh Sisson in 1995. Previously, Sisson operated Maryland's first brewpub, Sisson's. The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.

The fine attention to detail assures consistency of production and ultimately a great-tasting craft beer!Belt, Montana, is located 15 minutes southeast of Great Falls, and is home to about 700 fantastic Montanans.
