This amber beer was brewed in March (\"Marzenbier\") and left to age in cool lagering caves during the heat of the summer. Our rich and satisfying Bavarian-style OctoberFest comes from a special blend of imported German malts that creates a full-bodied brew and stresses a malty flavor and lingering aroma. Gently hopped and delicately balanced, its true-to-style, slow fermentation and long, cold maturation produces a luxuriously smooth, award-winning brew.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Octoberfest", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/oE1miM/upload_L8yxvJ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/oE1miM/upload_L8yxvJ-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/oE1miM/upload_L8yxvJ-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.05", "description": "M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.
