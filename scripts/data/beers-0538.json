This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "krIs45", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Juneau", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "streetAddress": "5429 Shaune Dr", "postalCode": "99801-9540", "website": "http://www.alaskanbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "907-780-5866", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Location", "latitude": 58.3570171, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alaska", "longitude": -134.4893459, "updateDate": "2015-12-03 19:08:04", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Alaskan", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:38:23", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-icon.png"}, "id": "VPHkaP", "name": "Alaskan Brewing Co."}], "srm": {"hex": "E58500", "id": 9, "name": "9"}, "servingTemperature": "cold", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 11:39:40", "ibu": "65", "createDate": "2014-03-17 09:52:07"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available at the same time of year, every year.", "id": 4, "name": "Seasonal"}, "isOrganic": "Y", "description": "A medium bodied, low hop character ale with added ginger, orange zest and cardamom.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Icycle Belgian Brown Ale", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.crankarmbrewing.com/", "established": "2013", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Welcome to Crank Arm Brewing!

Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it.
