Jason and Brian met in 2004 at the Mountain Sun family of breweries in Boulder, Colorado were they both learned to hone the craft they love.  With over 15 years of combined professional brewing experience and an uncanny ability to tolerate one another, they decided it was time to take a leap and chase the dream of opening their own brewery.\r\n\r\nWith both Jason and Brian calling Golden, Colorado home, the choice for a location was obvious.  After settling on a property on the north side of town, they wanted the brewery name to reflect the home town they loved.  After doing some research they learned that the original name for the majestic Clear Creek that runs through the center of Golden was Cannonball Creek.  The historical significance paired with the duo\u2019s love for the iconic Cannonball made the decision a no-brainer and Cannonball Creek Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nKnowing that they wouldn\u2019t be able to do it all on their own, Jason and Brian called upon former co-worker and professional brewer Jonathan Lee to help run the tasting room and work in the brewery.  Jonathan\u2019s experience as a craft beer bar manager, combined with his professional brewing experience made him the perfect fit.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-02-23 14:09:04", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nTue:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:00pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Golden", "createDate": "2013-02-23 14:09:36", "id": "CFIZtr", "streetAddress": "393 N.
