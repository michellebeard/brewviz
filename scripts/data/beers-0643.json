We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Tasting Room & Store Hours\r\nMonday-Friday, 11:00-7:00\r\nSaturday-Sunday, 10:00-5:00", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "id": "PckBjw", "streetAddress": "5401 Linda Vista Road", "postalCode": "92110", "extendedAddress": "#406", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(619) 295-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Home Brew Mart", "latitude": 32.7667586, "locationType": "tasting", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1952129, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:33:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "a7VHpi", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2012-12-07 00:05:42", "streetAddress": "10051 Old Grove Rd", "postalCode": "92131", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(858) 695-2739", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Scripps Ranch Brewery", "latitude": 32.898466, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.110794, "updateDate": "2015-06-11 14:39:57", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:03:59", "id": "cLcfTf", "streetAddress": "2215 India St", "postalCode": "92101", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(619) 255-7213", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Tasting Room & Kitchen", "latitude": 32.7277143, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1697202, "updateDate": "2015-06-11 13:48:56", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "1zYgG4", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2015-06-09 16:08:18", "streetAddress": "9045 Carroll Way", "postalCode": "92121", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2014", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "8587906900", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Miramar", "latitude": 32.8881618, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1580141, "updateDate": "2016-09-20 15:35:53", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon\u2013Sat 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSunday 11:00am\u20139:00pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2015-06-09 20:31:45", "id": "gRg0OA", "streetAddress": "9045 Carroll Way", "postalCode": "92121", "website": "www.ballastpoint.com", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "8587906900", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 32.8881618, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1580141, "updateDate": "2015-06-16 14:59:48", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "kr3KqQ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Long Beach", "createDate": "2016-06-21 19:31:36", "streetAddress": "110 N.

Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "12", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:48", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "Scottish Heavy", "abvMax": "4", "id": 8, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Heavy Ale"}, "createDate": "2016-04-06 18:24:32", "updateDate": "2016-04-06 18:24:32", "abv": "7.5", "styleId": 8, "id": "oOvsEO", "name": "Longship Scotch"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Longshore IPA", "nameDisplay": "Longshore IPA", "breweries": [{"website": "http://fieldworkbrewing.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Brewpub with a variety of seasonal house beer blends, plus savory pies, in an industrial setting.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-01-02 19:54:16", "locations": [{"website": "http://Www.fieldworkbrewery.com", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Berkeley", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "tasting", "region": "California", "countryIsoCode": "US", "longitude": -122.3019622, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "1160 6th st", "createDate": "2016-01-02 19:54:17", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-09-20 15:13:37", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "latitude": 37.8813589, "isPrimary": "N", "id": "s6TzkO", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Fieldwork", "updateDate": "2016-01-06 20:21:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rbEU7L/upload_DaSQc0-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rbEU7L/upload_DaSQc0-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rbEU7L/upload_DaSQc0-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rbEU7L/upload_DaSQc0-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rbEU7L/upload_DaSQc0-icon.png"}, "id": "rbEU7L", "name": "Fieldwork Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

This historical perspective is maintained at the tavern where commerce is held equal to community. Both being Rapid City natives, Karl Koth and Sam Papendick are the owners and brewers at Hay Camp Brewing Company. After graduating from Stevens High School, Karl moved to Minneapolis to earn a degree in Physics and Sam moved to Fort Collins to earn a degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering (interesting how both locations are craft beer meccas). After receiving their bachelors degrees, they were reacquainted when pursuing graduate degrees from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.\r\nOne evening at a local Rapid City ale house, they began talking about beer and homebrewing. Sam had a great garage and Karl had nearly 10 years brewing experience, so they began brewing beer in Sam's garage almost weekly. Equipment was accumulated, techniques were shared, and plenty of free beer was available for their friends. Karl was finishing his M.S. in Geological Engineering and Sam was in the middle of his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering when they decided to go legitimate. The LLC was formed in August 2012 and they entered the Student Governors Giant Vision Award contest, where they placed third, winning $2500.\r\nIt took nearly a year to find a suitable location, but they finally settled on an unused and beat up garage at the Fairmont Creamery (current location). After six months of renovation, the tavern opened January 1, 2014. The beginning was modest, with a 1.5 bbl brewehouse, a 42 gal Blichman fermenter, and two 1.5 bbl single walled fermenters, but their limited time and production complemented their limited overhead.\r\nKarl received his Masters degree and began working at the US Geological Survey and Sam was still finishing his PhD, so the beer was brewed on the weekends and Friday was the only open night. In August 2014, two additional 3 BBL jacketed fermenters were installed, essentially tripling their production capacity. In January 2015, Hay Camp opened on Thursday nights, where they collaborate with Black Hills Vinyl for live music and bingo.\r\nThe patio opened spring 2015, which expanded seating capacity and overall fun. Patrons could play corn hole, country bucket, or just soak up the nice summer sun. In July 2015, they ordered a new 3 BBL brewhouse and expect the delivery late fall.\r\nLong term, Hay Camp Brewing Company will remain true to it's Rapid City roots.

We are an artisinal nano-brewery in the city of Carpinteria, CA that focuses on creating small batch beers with an experimental approach. Rob and Steve met in 1999 and brewed their first batch of beer together in 2008. While attending UCSB, Rob met Peter while visiting Orella Ranch in Gaviota and they began brewing beer together in the Santa Barbara area. Then, in the summer of 2011, the three of them converged for a backpacking trip (pictured above) on The Lost Coast of Northern California - it was on this trip that they first discussed starting a brewery together. In late 2012 after some serious brainstorming and long meetings, the initiative had begun and planning was underway.\r\n \r\nIt is vitally important to us that we are directly involved with the production of our raw materials.  We are growing our own hops in the Santa Barbara area to supplement our usage, and in the future we plan to be growing enough to supply hops to the local community.  Our grains will be grown in the Santa Ynez Valley and malted right here in Santa Barbara.  All of our solid waste (spent grains, hops, yeast) will be fed to local pigs, local cricket farmers, or composted .  We will participate in, and contribute to, local festivals and events that revolve around brewing, environmentalism, and the promotion of local businesses.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-04-06 17:17:38", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Fri:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Carpinteria", "createDate": "2015-04-07 19:22:22", "id": "9Hqlzg", "streetAddress": "4191-8 Carpinteria Ave.", "postalCode": "93013", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "949.922.9152", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 34.4037704, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -119.5337568, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 19:22:22", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "brewLAB", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:07:16", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DFJoPF/upload_AttrGR-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DFJoPF/upload_AttrGR-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DFJoPF/upload_AttrGR-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DFJoPF/upload_AttrGR-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DFJoPF/upload_AttrGR-icon.png"}, "id": "DFJoPF", "name": "brewLAB"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "Rye beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast.
