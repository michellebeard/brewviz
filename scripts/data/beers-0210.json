It is one of the last remaining authentic lambic breweries of Belgium and well known for its lambic beer brewed along traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nLambic matures up to three years in wooden barrels, whereupon it is blended to make Oude Geuze. Sour cherries undergo fermentation in lambic beer and after a second fermentation in the bottle Oude Kriek is born. This unique brewing process with spontaneous fermentation is possible in Belgium in the Pajottenland region, the Zenne Valley and in Brussels, because of the presence of a specific microflora.\r\n\r\nDue to the absence of succession in the family business at the end of 2002, the traditional lambic beers of Oud Beersel were threatened to disappear. Shocked by the loss of this cultural and historical patrimony, the brewery was taken over in 2005 and business was restarted pursuing the principal aim to protect the time-honoured lambic beers, as well as the cultural and historical heritage of Oud Beersel for the coming generations.\r\n\r\nThis traditional brewery of lambic beers is nowadays managed in a modern way with respect for tradition and the m\u00e9tier. The traditional part of the production process of the lambic beers, in particular the spontaneous fermentation, the maturation of lambic in wooden barrels and the mixture of various lambic casks and vintages constitutes the core business of the company. The production process is completed in close collaboration with excellent partners who manage the industrial equipment. By the synergy between the m\u00e9tier and the industry, Oud Beersel offers authentic products of the highest quality.\r\n\r\nThanks to the success of the special Bersalis beers, i.e. the high fermentation beers of Oud Beersel, investments are continuously made to optimize the production process, to achieve the most demanding quality standards and to extend the infrastructure for the time-honoured lambic beers of Oud Beersel in order to meet the always growing demand.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Beersel", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Vlaams Brabant", "longitude": 4.3047963, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "Laarheiestraat 230", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}, "latitude": 50.7599724, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "6xIUOg", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brouwerij Oud Beersel", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:41:56", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EFaa8I/upload_ICWtsd-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EFaa8I/upload_ICWtsd-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EFaa8I/upload_ICWtsd-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EFaa8I/upload_ICWtsd-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EFaa8I/upload_ICWtsd-icon.png"}, "id": "EFaa8I", "name": "Brouwerij Oud Beersel"}], "name": "Bzart Lambiek", "nameDisplay": "Bzart Lambiek", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/WyaSuL/upload_BzodkI-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/WyaSuL/upload_BzodkI-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/WyaSuL/upload_BzodkI-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.047", "description": "Unblended, naturally and spontaneously fermented lambic is intensely estery, sour, and sometimes, but not necessarily, acetic flavored.
