Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:30:28", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Traverse City", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:32:00", "id": "1QFuku", "streetAddress": "2959 Hartman Rd", "postalCode": "49685", "website": "http://www.breweryterrafirma.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(231) 929-1600", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.7154521, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -85.6354376, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:36:47", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brewery Terra Firma", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-10-19 18:22:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-icon.png"}, "id": "dvuEzd", "name": "Brewery Terra Firma"}], "name": "Debauchery", "nameDisplay": "Debauchery", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/9tzgds/upload_93tIDt-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/9tzgds/upload_93tIDt-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/9tzgds/upload_93tIDt-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.036", "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

On that small 1 bbl brewing system we pinned our dreams and created the much-loved Hefeweizen.\r\n\r\nFINEST QUALITY INGREDIENTS, FRESHEST QUALITY RESULTS\r\nWith big dreams for a mircobrewery, Black Market opened to put Temecula, California on the map with a commitment to use only the best malt, hops and yeast\u00ad, all selected by hand to ensure quality.  The results were award-winning products with a reputation for craft excellence.\r\n\r\nGREAT BEER FROM WINE COUNTRY\r\nAs one of Temecula\u2019s first craft breweries, Black Market introduced locally brewed beers to the community. Now found far beyond Temecula, Black Market beers are on shelves and in establishments throughout Southern California, Arizona and Washington.\r\n\r\nLEADING A MOVEMENT\r\nLike many craft breweries before us, we have followed stories of those who came before us. We\u2019re proud to have launched the movement in Temecula, to keep inspiring the next waves of great beer with our success, and to continue to lead through our quality process, experimental hop releases, and innovative beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.blackmarketbrew.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Temecula", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "countryIsoCode": "US", "longitude": -117.169695, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "951-296-5039", "streetAddress": "41740 Enterprise Circle N. #109", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "92590", "latitude": 33.518599, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "0QiT0E", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Black Market", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:07:00", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/q9mkJy/upload_Hzy0Oq-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/q9mkJy/upload_Hzy0Oq-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/q9mkJy/upload_Hzy0Oq-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/q9mkJy/upload_Hzy0Oq-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/q9mkJy/upload_Hzy0Oq-icon.png"}, "id": "q9mkJy", "name": "Black Market Brewing Company"}], "ibu": "16", "servingTemperature": "cold", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 17:25:14", "createDate": "2014-09-10 14:51:04"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.duclaw.com/", "established": "1996", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "At DuClaw Brewing Company, we are very proud of our beers.

They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen.

The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.
