Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "12", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:48", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "Scottish Heavy", "abvMax": "4", "id": 8, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Heavy Ale"}, "createDate": "2015-10-30 18:37:51", "updateDate": "2015-12-18 05:06:33", "abv": "11", "styleId": 8, "id": "D7rTsw", "name": "Ride The Wendigo"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Ride Your Bike Double Red", "srmId": 33, "nameDisplay": "Ride Your Bike Double Red", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/u7vFe4/upload_aRBxRz-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/u7vFe4/upload_aRBxRz-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/u7vFe4/upload_aRBxRz-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.08", "description": "Imperial Red Ales are deep amber to dark copper/reddish brown.

But until a few years ago, no one told us about all the great Australian craft brewing happening, much of it done by our friends at Mountain Goat Beer.

So, Brooklyn brewer Al Duvall and lab manager Tom Price went down to Australia to visit Mountain Goat and collaboratively brew the cross-breed named Hopfweizenbock.\r\n\r\nNow it\u2019s the Goat Crew\u2019s turn for the 24-hour airplane trips to Brooklyn, as we bring you Ridgy-Didge, a strong saison with a distinctly Australian edge. We start the party with malt and a little candy sugar, and then rev it up with two native Australian flavors\u2014startlingly aromatic lemon myrtle leaves, and kicky Tasmanian pepperberries. After fermentation by our house Belgian yeast, the final touch is a light dry-hopping with the Australian hop variety Super Pride of Ringwood. The tasty result is a honey-colored beer with a lean, dry, hoppy palate and a bright, refreshingly lemony finish. This beer is a superstar at the summer dinner table, especially with grilled chicken, shrimp, salmon, and burgers.\r\n\r\nRidgy-Didge? Lemon myrtle? Tasmanian pepperberry? Super Pride of Ringwood?
