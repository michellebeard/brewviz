The Wildflower Caf\u00e9 had enormous success, which helped the inspiration for the Crooked Rooster Brewpub\u2019s opening in 1998, again founded by Doug Thayer.  Throughout the running of these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began to experiment in 2002 with home brewing.  Receiving excellent feedback on his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing\u2019s first official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown Ale) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Caf\u00e9 in 2004.  This was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale Ale.  The drastic name changes occurred because the originals were rejected due to \u201cimplied ingredients\u201d that weren\u2019t actually present in the beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Sun: 11:30 am - 12:30 am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Watkins Glen", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "id": "TxaTZN", "streetAddress": "223 - 301 North Franklin Street", "postalCode": "14891", "website": "http://www.roosterfishbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1990", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "607-535-9797", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.381121, "locationType": "micro", "region": "New York", "longitude": -76.874257, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Th\u00fcringen", "longitude": 12.0076316, "isClosed": "N", "createDate": "2012-08-12 14:45:22", "status": "deleted", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "latitude": 50.9307183, "isPrimary": "N", "id": "yS64Yy", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Deleted"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Roosterfish", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:05:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_ELX0K7-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_ELX0K7-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_ELX0K7-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_ELX0K7-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_ELX0K7-icon.png"}, "id": "WQyasy", "name": "Roosterfish Brewing Co."}], "name": "Tripel Witch Ale", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Tripel Witch Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/dhLXbk/upload_MoRAdo-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/dhLXbk/upload_MoRAdo-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/dhLXbk/upload_MoRAdo-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.085", "id": "dhLXbk", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 8, "name": "Tulip"}, "createDate": "2012-01-10 00:08:59", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 14:03:33", "abv": "9.2", "styleId": 59, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.07", "description": "Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port/ whiskey/ wine/ sherry/ other), base beer style or achieved character.

This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nOur brewing system also wouldn\u2019t be complete without putting thought into the storage of our beer. Many fantastic beers leave breweries and then suffer the consequences of entering the distribution chain that wasn\u2019t at all designed to deal with craft beer.
