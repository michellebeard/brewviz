Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.\r\nOnce Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.\r\nCurrently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.\r\n\r\n\"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\" - William Shakespeare", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thur: 11:30am - 9pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30am - 10pm\r\nSun: 11:30am - 9pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Nashville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "id": "qZJOHj", "streetAddress": "60 Molly Ln", "postalCode": "47448", "website": "http://www.bigwoodsbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "813-988-6000", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.2079575, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -86.2484171, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Quaff On!", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-10-11 13:02:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-icon.png"}, "id": "f8oZ5j", "name": "Quaff On!

Whether developing new styles, adapting established ones, or bringing the less well-known styles back into the limelight, we create each beer with the same level of care, attention and respect.\r\nAll of these carefully crafted beers are brewed with the finest natural ingredients and packaged alive, in both bottle and KeyKeg, to ensure a natural carbonation and allow flavours to evolve over time. The harshest critics of our own work, we only release beers that are of a high standard, balanced and drinkable.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE INSPIRATION\r\n\r\nBefore brewing together, Dave and Tom took their inspiration from opposite sides of the world.  Dave discovered craft beer in Australia and New Zealand, while Tom, introduced to The Kernel Brewery during the early days, was blown away by the intensity and variety of flavours that come from the new world hops they were using.\r\n\r\nSince brewing together, Tom and Dave took a trip to Belgium for the Festival of Spontaneous Fermentation \u2013 a weekend dedicated to Gueuze and Lambic beers \u2013 and were taken aback by the refreshing crispness of Belgian Saisons and the funky acidity created by the wild yeast Brettanomyces, intrigued by the herbal and spicy tartness of Witbiers, and blown away by the rich complexity of the Abbey style ales.\r\n\r\nBrew By Numbers continues to draw inspiration from other breweries in the States and the UK as well as taking inspiration from flavour combinations from everyday life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING\r\n\r\nTom and Dave met in China on a rock climbing tour around Asia.  After hanging out on the rocks and riding motorbikes around Vietnamese islands and the hilly borderlands between Laos and Myanmar they formed a solid friendship.\r\n\r\nIn April 2011, Dave returned from travelling after two years in the Antipodes, drinking craft beer and doing some basic homebrew.  At the same time, Tom \u2013 an old friend of Toby from the Kernel \u2013 was drinking their IPAs and Pale Ales, wondering how he could do them differently.\r\n\r\nBy August that year Dave and Tom, committed to opening their own microbrewery, had secured the use of a friend\u2019s basement on Southwark Bridge Road and built a simple homebrew kit.  Through reading books on brewing, researching online, and asking for tips and advice from friends in the industry, Dave and Tom began to teach themselves to brew.\r\n\r\nThe first three brews were made with malt extract, boiled with hops to give flavour and bitterness, and fermented in plastic buckets.  From brew 4 onwards Dave and Tom moved to all-grain mashes, using malted grains instead of extract to achieve more authentic results.\r\n\r\nTheir set-up was rudimentary: a 50ltr coolbox with homemade copper manifold and sparge arm and a plastic container for both hot liquor (water) tank (HLT) and boil kettle.  But results were good, and by brews 6 and 7 people were seeing potential.\r\n\r\nDave and Tom progressed quickly.  This was, in part, because they would split batches at different stages to create variations of each brew \u2013 whether at the boil to allow different hop and spice additions, in the fermentor to allow the use of different yeasts, or post-fermentation to allow the use of dry hopping, infusions or wild yeasts.  By doing this, original recipes and methods were developed.\r\n\r\nIn February 2012 a French Saison yeast strain was brought to London for a collaboration brew between two prominent UK brewers.  That strain gradually made its way around London\u2019s breweries, finally reaching Dave and Tom, and by brew 20 they made their first Citra Saison.  Now officially Brew By Numbers, Dave and Tom took this \u2018Hoppy Saison\u2019 to the staff at Craft Beer Co. Clerkenwell for their critique.\r\n\r\nJune 2012 and Dave and Tom visited Belgium with Andy from Partizan Brewing (then still brewing at Redemption) and Toby from the Kernel.  Upon returning, inspired by the trip, BBNo. brewed their first Brett-aged Saison and began planning to brew Witbiers and Belgian Blonde Ales.\r\n\r\nIn July 2012 a generous philanthropist donated enough money for Dave and Tom to move to stainless equipment \u2013 for HLT/kettle and mash tun, at least.  This investment allowed many upgrades that would help BBNo. achieve their goal of selling beer brewed in their basement space.\r\n\r\nThey achieved that goal when in November 2012 they received permission from Southwark Council to brew beer for sale and on December 1st hosted the official launch party of Brew By Numbers at The Craft Beer Co. in Clerkenwell.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE BREWHOUSE\r\n\r\nWith the recent flourish of microbreweries in the UK the demand for and cost of used brewhouses is high.  BBNo. was faced with two options: spend a lot on a small, second-hand brewhouse, or create our own.  The choice was easy, so inspired by the craft breweries of Australia and New Zealand \u2013 where brewery-specific equipment is scarce \u2013 we decided to convert used stainless soft drink and dairy vessels to create our own bespoke brewhouse.\r\n\r\nBBNo.\u2019s brewhouse has one of the smallest footprints of any 12 barrel (bbl) brewery in the UK, with a gravity fed whirlpool allowing the brewers to use hop pellets in the boil for maximum flavour extraction.  The cladding and banding were all done by hand, in-house, with the help of some volunteers.\r\n\r\nNow the brewhouse is finished, the old tanks are ready to enjoy their latest incarnation, making some of the finest beer south of the river.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE PILOT KIT\r\n\r\nExperimentation has always been a mainstay of our approach to brewing.  With the 12bbl brewhouse up and running our original brew kit has become our pilot kit.  On this kit we develop new ideas and recipes, testing new ingredients and creating short-run, limited-release batches.\r\n\r\nThe pilot kit is one tenth the size of our new brewhouse, making the upscaling of recipes quite simple.  Furthermore, wort from the large brewhouse can be collected and used to create different recipe variations.  From brewing Imperial versions of the main batch to creating a series of Coffee Porters, this flexibility allows us to push the boundaries of our understanding and continually extend our knowledge.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out for the red Pi stamp indicating these exclusive new brews.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTHE LOCATION\r\n\r\nBBNo. HQ stands shoulder to shoulder with other artisan producers in the heart of Bermondsey\u2019s culinary quarter, a stone\u2019s throw from the popular Maltby Street Market and Spa Terminus.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOPEN DAYS AND EVENTS\r\n\r\nBrew By Numbers is open every Saturday from 10:00-17:00 and we welcome visitors to try our latest creations.  These include the freshest releases from our brewhouse along with limited edition Pilot brews sold exclusively on site, and even a few experimental beer and malt cocktails.  Beer can be consumed on site or in bottle to take away.\r\n\r\nOther private events, such as beer tastings and food pairings, are set to take place next year.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Fridays 3pm - 7pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Centralia", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "id": "TkT8Rc", "streetAddress": "5945 Prather Road", "postalCode": "98531", "website": "http://dicksbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-586-7760", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 46.771347, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -123.007543, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Dick's", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:44:31", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-icon.png"}, "id": "GC3a1f", "name": "Dick's Brewing Company"}], "name": "12 Man", "nameDisplay": "12 Man", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/SIypH1/upload_4AMPJJ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/SIypH1/upload_4AMPJJ-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/SIypH1/upload_4AMPJJ-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
