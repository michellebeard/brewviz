It\u2019s a place where we build our hopes and dreams, storing them on the wall neat as garden tools. Really, the garage is a hub. A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return.\r\n\r\nWe hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You\u2019ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d You can almost smell the oil and beer.\r\n\r\nBut more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It\u2019s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.\r\n\r\nFor Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan\u2019s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He\u2019s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary family.)\r\n\r\nSo welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You\u2019re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented. It\u2019s a great deal of work, but hell, that\u2019s what makes a dream worth pursuing.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.
