After homebrewing on the family farm for years, homebrewer Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "TSKxwK", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Black River Falls", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "streetAddress": "320 Pierce St", "postalCode": "54615", "extendedAddress": "Box 187", "website": "http://www.sandcreekbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1998", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(715) 284-7553", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Sand Creek Brewing Co", "latitude": 44.2830622, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -90.7913227, "updateDate": "2015-12-04 17:57:24", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Sand Creek", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:56:58", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_RPFu23-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_RPFu23-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_RPFu23-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_RPFu23-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_RPFu23-icon.png"}, "id": "gsADrL", "name": "Sand Creek Brewing Company"}], "ibu": "35", "servingTemperature": "cold", "updateDate": "2015-12-18 02:38:09", "createDate": "2015-08-04 18:58:58"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.3monkeysbrewing.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Two Monkeys Brewing Co", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:11", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "pF0ajA", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Madera", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:11", "streetAddress": "24566 Brook Dr", "postalCode": "93638", "website": "http://www.3monkeysbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "559-363-2709", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 37.001409, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -120.101067, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Two Monkeys", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:22:50", "id": "SZEQ8h", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "name": "American Pale Ale", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "American Pale Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/zsLzJs/upload_QK2VwG-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/zsLzJs/upload_QK2VwG-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/zsLzJs/upload_QK2VwG-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds \u2013 beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.\r\n\r\nWhile German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.
