This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

We are inspired by the craft brewers before us who have challenged the palates of beer drinkers, been brave enough to brew something unique and not follow the status quo of the beer world.\r\nThe core philosophy of the brewery is to make beer that excites us and to make beer that we love to drink.  In no way will we let supply, the market or budgeting compromise the quality of 7 cent beer.  If other people want to drink it, bathe in it, rub it on their hips and let it eat through to their liver, freeze it into ice blocks in winter and skate on it, then melt it in spring time and drink it, or whatever they decide to do with it, it\u2019s all an added bonus for us.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-02-23 04:47:31", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "pky8dy", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Gisborne South", "createDate": "2015-02-23 23:28:14", "streetAddress": "Couangalt Rd", "latitude": -37.5409914, "website": "http://7cent.com.au/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "AU", "postalCode": "3437", "isClosed": "N", "name": "7 Cent Brewing", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Victoria", "longitude": 144.6158616, "updateDate": "2015-11-20 17:58:10", "country": {"displayName": "Australia", "name": "AUSTRALIA", "isoThree": "AUS", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 36, "isoCode": "AU"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "7 Cent", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:05:17", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yzjEGx/upload_Ca1NEt-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yzjEGx/upload_Ca1NEt-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yzjEGx/upload_Ca1NEt-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yzjEGx/upload_Ca1NEt-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yzjEGx/upload_Ca1NEt-icon.png"}, "id": "yzjEGx", "name": "7 Cent Brewery"}], "description": "Who doesn\u2019t like em\u2019 big & beady.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
