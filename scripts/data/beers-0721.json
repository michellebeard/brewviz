Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:21:11", "fgMax": "1.028", "shortName": "Scotch Ale", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "id": "pIGfZ4", "createDate": "2016-11-10 19:35:56", "updateDate": "2016-11-10 19:35:56", "abv": "8", "styleId": 15, "ibu": "29", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Nitro Milk Stache", "nameDisplay": "Nitro Milk Stache", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.
