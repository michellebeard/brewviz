While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage \u2014 an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-04-08 13:11:43", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "Zhydrx", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Vista", "createDate": "2014-04-08 13:13:42", "streetAddress": "2545 Progress Street", "postalCode": "92081", "extendedAddress": "Suite D", "website": "http://boozebrothersbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(760) 295-0217", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.148172, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.218047, "updateDate": "2015-08-26 16:23:19", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Booze Brothers", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:53:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-icon.png"}, "id": "xaBLno", "name": "Booze Brothers Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-11-24 00:48:05", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Farmington", "createDate": "2014-11-24 00:51:59", "id": "fSqavF", "streetAddress": "33336 Grand River", "postalCode": "48336", "website": "http://fbcbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2014", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(248) 957-9543", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Farmington Brewing Company", "latitude": 42.464946, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -83.375958, "updateDate": "2016-04-10 21:15:14", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Farmington", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-04-10 21:15:30", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ohbgYE/upload_WwIcxm-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ohbgYE/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ohbgYE/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ohbgYE/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ohbgYE/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png"}, "id": "ohbgYE", "name": "Farmington Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 12, "name": "Mead, Cider, & Perry"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Variable, but should be a medium, refreshing drink.

Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association\u2019s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com.

Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices.

This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it\u2019s capacity, and soon Fegley\u2019s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities. Perhaps there\u2019s another fragrant wallflower ready to dance.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "Jio9R0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Allentown", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "streetAddress": "812 W Hamilton St", "postalCode": "18101", "website": "http://www.thebrewworks.com/allentown-brewworks/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1998", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "610.433.7777", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Fegley's Allentown Brew Works", "latitude": 40.6013531, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.4739451, "updateDate": "2015-10-21 15:03:28", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Fegley's Bethlehem Brew Works", "locality": "Bethlehem", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.3821851, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "610-882-1300", "streetAddress": "569 Main Street", "createDate": "2015-10-21 15:03:28", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-10-21 15:03:28", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "18018", "latitude": 40.6222629, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "SAPoSh", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Fegley's Brew Works", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:38:31", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-icon.png"}, "id": "Rx4Dnt", "name": "Fegley's Brew Works"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.036", "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.004", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:34:55", "fgMax": "1.016", "shortName": "Saison", "abvMax": "8.5", "id": 72, "srmMin": "4", "name": "French & Belgian-Style Saison"}, "id": "g6f7Mc", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 8, "name": "Tulip"}, "createDate": "2013-08-09 15:16:34", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 04:48:38", "abv": "6.8", "styleId": 72, "availableId": 2, "glasswareId": 8, "ibu": "27", "name": "Apricot au Poivre Saison"}]
