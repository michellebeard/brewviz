It\u2019s in the Wagner kitchen where Eric first combined his passion and talent for gourmet cooking with over 20 years of engineering expertise, specifically in treating water. Who knew that brewing delicious beer was so similar to the science of treating water? The process of releasing enzymes to break down starches into sugar and fermenting the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide is second nature to a water engineer, while balancing delicious flavor is what a gourmet cook strives for. Hence the \u201cblueprint\u201d for great beer was born! Eric\u2019s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint.\r\n\r\nBetter than a recipe, a brewing \u201cblueprint\u201d combines science and great culinary skill to create a Br\u00fceprint.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery\u2014Br\u00fceprint Brewing Company. The Wagner family, that is Br\u00fceprint, is dedicated to traditional social interaction while sampling delicious beer. Our hope is that you\u2019ll rest your phone for a few minutes to have a real conversation, partake in or watch a game with friends, or take in a great band.
