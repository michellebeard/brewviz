Since opening, Mary Ann and Mike remain hands-on owners\r\n\r\nThere are copper tanks which have become part of the Pub\u2019s unique and cozy ambiance. Everyone who walks through the Pub doors is immediately made to feel at home by the friendly staff. The beers brewed on site have won many awards. All the elements of Mary Ann and Mike\u2019s vision.\r\n\r\nBrewmaster, Tim Gallagher, supplies the Pub with a selection of beer for any taste preference. Since Tim started brewing, he has created new popular beer recipes, production has more than doubled and their signature Cloverdale Ale has skyrocketed in popularity. CLOVER- DALE beer is now served on tap at several venues around the county, as well as sold in bottles at a number of retail outlets.\r\n\r\nThe Pub\u2019s team (service staff, kitchen staff, Tim, Mary Ann and Mike) is dedicated to brewing the best hand-crafted beers, serving good food and keeping the atmosphere friendly.\r\n\r\nExpansion is in the future to keep up with the demand for Ruth McGowan\u2019s beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "mrp7pZ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cloverdale", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "streetAddress": "131 E 1st St", "postalCode": "95425", "website": "http://www.ruthmcgowansbrewpub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "707-894-9610", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.8055866, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -123.0159168, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Ruth McGowans Brewpub", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:25:48", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cY1yJf/upload_TNJeBH-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cY1yJf/upload_TNJeBH-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cY1yJf/upload_TNJeBH-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cY1yJf/upload_TNJeBH-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cY1yJf/upload_TNJeBH-icon.png"}, "id": "cY1yJf", "name": "Ruth McGowans Brewpub"}], "description": "Brewed in the tradition of Ireland's famous export.

Joleen and Brian Durham, owners, have lived and farmed in Texas County for many years, and they have enjoyed craft beer for a long time, too.\r\n\r\nToday, Joleen and Brian live up the hill from the Little Piney River that flows into the Big Piney.  They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.\r\n\r\nJoleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nThe barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a \u201cnanobrewery\u201d, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.

That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews.
