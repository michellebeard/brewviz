Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers.

Eel River Brewing wants to show their commitment to sustainability and encourage others to do so by producing a sustainable, organic beer that promotes Earth Day and supports a like-minded non-profit.\r\n\r\nEarth Thirst, a Double IPA, will be brewed with over 3 pounds of hops per barrel throughout the brewing process, giving it a fresh and intense aroma. When it comes to Double IPAs, Head Brewer Mike Smith says that \u201cit\u2019s all about hop flavor and aroma from the dry hops. The flavor depends on the hops that you use. Since this beer uses Cascade and Centennial hops, it has a heavy floral aroma and citrus flavor.\u201d What makes this Double IPA unique is that it uses the highest quality, all organic ingredients - all from the Pacific Northwest. According to Smith, \u201cThe more locally produced ingredients are the more fresh they are when we get them, allowing the flavors to come out more.\u201d Earth Thirst is not only 100% organic, but 100% sustainable also as Eel River Brewing is 100% bio-mass powered. Eel River Brewing will begin shipping out their Earth Thirst beer at the end of March with only limited quantities available since Earth Thirst is a specialty release. To help promote organics and sustainability, a portion of the proceeds of Earth Thirst will be donated to CCOF.\r\n\r\nEel River Brewing chose to work with CCOF due to their practices and beliefs. CCOF is the only full-service organic certification agency and trade association that provides benefits on behalf of it members. CCOF certifies over 2,400 clients in the US, Mexico and Canada and its members and clients receive full trade association benefits, which include advocacy, education, marketing support and networking opportunities for the organic community (CCOF.org).

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.
