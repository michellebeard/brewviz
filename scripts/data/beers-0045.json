These recipes and their styling are often layered with a culinary perspective along with visions of a cold frothy beer at the end of a long day making wine. In 2012 we began to turn this passion into a reality.  We reached out to the community around us, the barrel suppliers, equipment manufacturers and our local farmers to literally test the waters.  We pulled barrels and equipment from our wineries and began building a custom brewing system (2 beer barrel system).  In 2014 we found a small space in St Helena, received a use permit and began creating our beers in July of this year\u2026Wow! How did that happen?

And those textbooks are right; especially about the 1791 part.\r\n\r\nToday, in Franklin County, Vermont, Army veteran Steve Gagner is honoring his home state and passion \u2013 brewing great beer \u2013 with 14th Star Brewing Co.\r\n\r\n14th Star is Steve\u2019s 1,200-square-foot nanobrewery on Lower Newton Street, in St. Albans City.\r\n\r\nNanobreweries make less than four-barrel batches, and as of your eyes hitting this paragraph, there are still less than 100 nanobreweries in America.\r\n\r\nWhat makes 14th Star stand out? Well, it\u2019s about the only brewery in Vermont that\u2019s located above Burlington. Period.\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not it. Not entirely.\r\n\r\nYou see \u2013 this is your beer. Oh, sure, Steve plans on starting you off with one-barrel batches of pale ale, brown ale, and Belgian white. There will be more, of course, but that\u2019s up to you. So tell Steve what style beer you want in your 14th Star growler at: steve@14thstarbrewing.com.\r\nOn our end, we are readying to open our doors. Our goal is this July. (Check out our Pint of Progress on our home page.)\r\n\r\nWe can\u2019t wait to watch you let your hair down and lift your glass, Vermont. We\u2019ll enjoy that.
