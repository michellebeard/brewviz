We had always believed that if we were going to brew an IPA, that it better be extraordinary. Continuing a tradition from our home brewing roots, when neighbors and friends grew hops to contribute to our annual fresh-hopped IPA, we reached out to Richmond's very passionate beer community to invite home hop growers to donate some of their fresh harvest. Sure enough, they came through. With fresh hop contributions from local home growers, Hardywood RVA IPA captures the terroir of Richmond and the spirit of its hop growing beer enthusiasts. A wet-hopped, American-style India Pale Ale with loads of fresh local Columbus, Cascade, Chinook, Centennial and Glacier hops, Hardywood RVA IPA displays a toasted auburn color with a vibrant, creamy head. Cedar, citrus and herbal notes pervade the aroma, while the flavor offers a floral character and a delightful, resinous mouthfeel that can only be achieved with an assertive dose of freshly harvested hops. Medium- to full-bodied, Hardywood RVA IPA finishes with lingering hints of grapefruit and honey. While only 40 gallons of the inaugural RVA IPA were brewed on the pilot brewery in 2011, Hardywood plans to offer local gardeners free hop rhizomes each spring with educational materials on growing and harvesting hops, and the hope for a portion of their bounty at harvest time. We're hopeful that Hardywood RVA IPA will not only evolve as a unique annual beer offering, but as a fun, community building experience.
