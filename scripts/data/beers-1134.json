In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "HeStKS", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Potosi", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "streetAddress": "209 South Main Street", "postalCode": "53820", "extendedAddress": "Box 177", "website": "http://www.potosibrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1852", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-763-4002", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.6716654, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -90.7271709, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Potosi", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-24 17:44:52", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png"}, "id": "Q4eTmd", "name": "Potosi Brewing Company"}], "description": "Layers of flavor delight in our Belgian Style Witbier.

The funny thing is, this beer is by no means new\u2026\r\nWelcome to the world of beer, circa 1200 AD.\r\nGruit Ale (pronounced \u201cgrew-it\u201d) was what beer was throughout the Middle Ages in Continental Europe. Hopped beers came much later, and that story is perhaps too long to tell on this one page (but ask me and I\u2019ll tell you, over a pint or two of gruit).\r\nGruit is primarily a combination of three herbs: sweet gale (Myrica gale), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and wild rosemary (Ledum palustre). Additionally, individual brewers would add other herbs and spices as they liked to produce unique flavors and aromas in their beer. These herbs were known for their mildly stimulating properties, and when added to fermented beer were known to have said inebriating qualities amplified. I will make a bold statement now: Gruit Ale may be highly intoxicating and aphrodisiacal when consumed in significant quantity. Historically, it has been said to stimulate the mind, create euphoria, and enhance sexual drive. When you consider that hops contain large quantities of estrogenic and soporific compounds (in other words, they dull sex drive and make you sleepy), one wonders how that strange bitter plant became not just dominant but exclusive in brewing much the world over. All of the above herbs, hops included, have known culinary and/or medicinal benefits. And all have been used by humans for tens of thousands of years. They are all known to be bacteriostatic (meaning they keep beer from going bad) and offer bitter or astringent compounds to balance the sweetness of malted barley.\r\nAnyone already a fan of our Heather Ale will find this beer not too far of a stretch. Utilizing the above-mentioned herbs plus wild licorice root and nettles, it has an interesting and pleasant aroma and flavor of green- (think good Japanese Sencha) with overtones of herbal- tea (think Echinacea/mint/chamomile/licorice). Of course, this is balanced by the faithful familiarity of Scottish and British pale and dark caramel malted barley, along with wheat malt and oats. It is medium in body, and deep amber in color. Full, rich, and malty on the palate and smooooth in the finish.

The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to very dark amber. Darker (dunkel) styles should have a detectable degree of roast malt in the balance without being robust in overall character.
