Its unique tart qualities make it an ideal fruit to use in the cider making process. Much of making a good cider is finding the perfect balance between acid, sugar and tannins. With Original Sin Elderberry, the Company believes it has achieved this balance. There is a long history of Elderberries being used in cider production. In fact, in the 1822 book \u2018The American Orchardist\u2019, it suggests adding Elderberries to give \u201ccider a fine color as well as flavor.\"", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Elderberry Cider", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/GMkhhG/upload_S6xTDm-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/GMkhhG/upload_S6xTDm-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/GMkhhG/upload_S6xTDm-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 12, "name": "Mead, Cider, & Perry"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Like a dry wine with complex flavors.
