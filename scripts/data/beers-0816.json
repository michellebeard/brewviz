These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "10", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "4", "ibuMax": "17", "abvMin": "4.8", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:32:30", "fgMax": "1.01", "shortName": "Witbier", "abvMax": "5.2", "id": 65, "srmMin": "2", "name": "Belgian-Style White (or Wit) / Belgian-Style Wheat"}, "id": "14ifbQ", "createDate": "2016-01-10 01:05:08", "updateDate": "2016-01-10 01:06:06", "abv": "5.4", "styleId": 65, "ibu": "16", "name": "Plain Jane"}]
