These beers were originally brewed in March and left to lager in cold storage until being served at the Octoberfest celebration in late September. This extended cold conditioning helps these beers to be very smooth and crisp for the fall season.\r\n\r\nTrue to tradition, Sebago Brewing Company's Octoberfest was brewed in March of 2011 and spent the summer months conditioning at a chilly 33F until September, which helped harmonize the malt flavors and gentle hop character of this lager. It was fermented at lower temperatures with a lager strain of yeast we do not typically use.\r\n\r\nOctoberfest is unfiltered and may have a slight haze to its amber color which disappears as the beer warms slightly. Its bready aroma is followed by a subtle grain and toffee flavor with a medium body that finishes crisply. At 6.1% ABV, this Fest Beer is slightly stronger than most beers, but gentle enough to enjoy more than one.
