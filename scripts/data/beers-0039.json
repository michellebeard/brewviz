The Saratoga Resort and Spa consistently draws people from all over Colorado and Wyoming due to its unique offering of a variety of amenities in one location--such as an on-site brewery, mineral hot spring pools, great food, western-styled rooms, jeep, ATV and snowmobile rentals, a golf course and a full-service spa.  \r\n\r\nThe Snowy Mountain Brewery is gaining in exposure and was featured recently in Travel Pulse\u2019s \u201c5 Unique Beer Vacation Spots in the U.S.!\u201d  The name Snowy Mountain is fitting for the brewery as it sits adjacent the majestic Snowy Range Mountains, in southern Wyoming. Boasting 8-10 different craft beers throughout each season, the Snowy Mountain Brewery is one of the fastest growing breweries in Wyoming and surrounding states. The famous brewpub, with a throw-back to the wild west, is adorned with big game mounts and bar-stools made with six-shooters and patinated saddles and features a full pub menu with selections that compliment Saratoga's finest craft beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Hours: 11am to Close, Daily", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Saratoga", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "id": "6txGoK", "streetAddress": "601 Pic Pike Rd", "postalCode": "82331", "extendedAddress": "PO Box 869", "website": "http://www.saratogaresortandspa.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "307-326-5261", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Snowy Mountain Pub & Brewery", "latitude": 41.4529922, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Wyoming", "longitude": -106.8015215, "updateDate": "2015-06-04 18:45:46", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Snowy Mountain", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:26:24", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_Ayx34n-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_Ayx34n-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_Ayx34n-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_Ayx34n-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_Ayx34n-icon.png"}, "id": "u8Rbm0", "name": "Snowy Mountain Brewery"}], "description": "Very light, clear color from pale to golden yellow and a lightly hopped aroma and flavor.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Alpenglow Pilsner", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/xw4faK/upload_Pcjpk1-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/xw4faK/upload_Pcjpk1-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/xw4faK/upload_Pcjpk1-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 8, "name": "North American Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.
