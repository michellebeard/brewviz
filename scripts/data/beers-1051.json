The Bottle Imp was brewed in collaboration with David Thompson, winner of the 2012 Toronto Beer Week Homebrew Contest.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Imperial Stout style is brewed to weigh in high on alcohol, with the roasted, malty character typical of a stout. The style was first brewed in England in the 18th century, and exported to Russia for the pleasure of Czarina Catherine II and her court.\r\n\r\nThe Bottle Imp is a haunting turn-of-the-century tale by Robert Louis Stevenson about risking eternal damnation of the soul to have everything on earth one\u2019s heart desires. We suggest pairing the beer and the story on a cold night by a crackling fire.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes\r\n\r\nThe Bottle Imp is black, rich and malty, with a mouthfeel best described as liquid silk. The roasty dark malt character is complemented by fruit notes that suggest dates and figs, as well as subtle notes of black licorice.
