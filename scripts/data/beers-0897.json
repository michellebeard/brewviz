The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-05-10 18:56:21", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "oN5ry0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bangor", "createDate": "2013-05-10 19:02:53", "streetAddress": "570 Main Street", "postalCode": "04401", "website": "http://www.geaghanspub.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "207-945-3730", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.786998, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Maine", "longitude": -68.777343, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Geaghan Brothers", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:42:57", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-icon.png"}, "id": "jmyqSv", "name": "Geaghan Brothers Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor.

Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious.

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you\u2019ll find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers, both brewed in house and imported from the far reaches of the globe, eat a tasty meal and even brew your own beer!\r\n\r\nEngine 15 \u2013 Eat, Drink, Brew!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:54", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tue - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Jacksonville Beach", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:54", "id": "E6WUse", "streetAddress": "1500 Beach Blvd", "postalCode": "32250", "website": "http://www.engine15.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "904-249-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 30.287586, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Florida", "longitude": -81.4081999, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Engine 15", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:18:54", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VajTuz/upload_NgL0g3-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VajTuz/upload_NgL0g3-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VajTuz/upload_NgL0g3-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VajTuz/upload_NgL0g3-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VajTuz/upload_NgL0g3-icon.png"}, "id": "VajTuz", "name": "Engine 15 Brewing Company"}], "description": "This amber colored rye beer combines the citrus and floral character of a classic american ipa with the spicy earthy notes of a rye ale. hoppy but not too bitter and just enough spice to give you a little.", "srmId": 12, "nameDisplay": "Route 90 Rye", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/NUHohR/upload_Oa4104-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/NUHohR/upload_Oa4104-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/NUHohR/upload_Oa4104-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "Rye beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast.
