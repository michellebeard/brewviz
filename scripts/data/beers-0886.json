Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:21:11", "fgMax": "1.028", "shortName": "Scotch Ale", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "ibu": "26.6", "name": "Robster Craw"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Robust Cherry Porter", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Robust Cherry Porter", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor.
