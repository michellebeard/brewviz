Along with this they had brought the recipe of a forgotten brew called Tej - the fabled gift to King Solomon from the Queen of Sheba. Under instruction in her family kitchen, an elderly woman taught us the process of its brewing, sharing the long-preserved and refined heritage to exact the brew to perfection.\r\n\r\nAlongside the Lost Tribes range of inspired traditional beers sits the signature series.

However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing.

A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX K\u00c3\u00b6lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish.

The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels.

Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.
