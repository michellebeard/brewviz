Our name is a fusion of 'brewery' with our family name, Rue.\r\n\r\nOur calling is to create beers with character and depth using the simplest and purest of means. We do not filter or pasteurize our beers. Most of our bottled beers gain carbonation through bottle conditioning, allowing carbonation to naturally occur through a secondary bottle fermentation. We strive to use unconventional ingredients, and we will proudly state what we put in our beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Placentia", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "id": "st9day", "streetAddress": "715 Dunn Way", "postalCode": "92870", "website": "http://www.thebruery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "714-996-6258", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.8613833, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.8800107, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "The Bruery", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:00:07", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4MVtcc/upload_5OYqW3-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4MVtcc/upload_5OYqW3-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4MVtcc/upload_5OYqW3-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4MVtcc/upload_5OYqW3-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4MVtcc/upload_5OYqW3-icon.png"}, "id": "4MVtcc", "name": "The Bruery"}], "originalGravity": "1.00405", "id": "K1NXJm", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-03-31 17:31:07", "updateDate": "2014-04-01 14:36:07", "abv": "6.28", "styleId": 61, "availableId": 2, "srm": {"hex": "FBB123", "id": 5, "name": "5"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.054", "description": "Belgian-style blond ales are characterized by low yet evident hop bitterness, flavor, and sometimes aroma.

This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house.

Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.

After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.

We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.
