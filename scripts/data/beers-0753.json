It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania.

They devised a plan to build a brewery in beautiful Birmingham \u2013 Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe group found an excellent location for the brewery in the Pepper Place/Lakeview district of Birmingham on 3rd Avenue South.  The 8000 Square foot building houses the brewery and tasting room.  The building was selected for it\u2019s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Cahaba Brewing Company has had the goal of providing Birmingham with clean and consistent craft beers with a broad variety flavors and styles.  To do this, CBC hand selected and assembled the brewing equipment necessary for the job.  As luck would have it, our friends at Straight To Ale, in Huntsville, AL were in the process of upgrading their brewery and they had just purchased all of the equipment from Old Town Brewery.  After purchasing their equipment, we were just about ready to go.  The set-up consists of a Premier Stainless 3.5 bbl brewhouse outfitted with four 7 bbl fermenters and two 7 bbl brite tanks.\r\n\r\nCahaba continued to grow and found a new location to begin the expansion process in early 2015. Celebrating \"Last Pint Night\" at the original 3rd Ave South location in mid-January 2016, the new 51,000 square foot building, located in the Historical Continental Gin, is ready to open. First day to officially open was January 19th, 2016. Not only is the space much larger, the production facility is also expanding from a 3.5 bbl brewhouse to a 30 bbl brewhouse. The new set up consists of three 60 bbl brite tanks and one 120 bbl brite tank. In addition, the 3.5 bbl system from the original building will join the larger tanks at the new facility and will be used for smaller batches. Cahaba will also begin canning various styles of beer in-house. These cans will join the already launched American Blonde that went into the local market in early 2015. The new taproom offers a window looking into the production facility, a covered patio, and ample parking. The space is also flexible, offering multiple options for all varieties of private event needs such as weddings, reunions, corporate events, and birthday parties.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-07-21 22:45:16", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "hMvwjg", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Birmingham", "createDate": "2012-07-21 22:46:42", "streetAddress": "4500 5th Ave South", "postalCode": "35222", "extendedAddress": "Building C", "website": "http://cahababrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "205-578-2616", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.526729, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alabama", "longitude": -86.764854, "updateDate": "2016-02-02 17:43:17", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Cahaba", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-02-02 17:39:14", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/63i9qL/upload_D2X7RV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/63i9qL/upload_D2X7RV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/63i9qL/upload_D2X7RV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/63i9qL/upload_D2X7RV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/63i9qL/upload_D2X7RV-icon.png"}, "id": "63i9qL", "name": "Cahaba Brewing Company"}], "description": "Our Fall seasonal is our take on an Oktoberfest style beer.
