It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale.

It really was a beer that named itself (although many of the regulars here will tell you it was named in their honor).\r\n\r\nRat Logo In an effort to get our first beer brewed and aged in time for the Santa Rosa Beer Festival (at the LBC) we found ourselves lacking a few key ingredients. They included grain and yeast. We borrowed some grain from Third Street Aleworks, some more from Bear Republic , and Brian at Moonlight Brewing was kind enough to lend us a couple of kegs to put it in.\r\n\r\nAnyway, what is the Rat Bastard Pale Ale? Jay Brooks of the (Brookston Beer Bulletin) said \"The Rat Bastard is a well-made pale ale, with good aromas and a crisp, clean palate. It has a generous hop bite that finishes bitter, then drops off sharply in the end.\"\r\nThe Rat is a very chuggable drop. Coming in at just under 6%, it's a fine session beer with a clean dry finish. With its balanced hop profile the Rat is crisp on the tongue and pleasant (slightly floral with some citrus) to the nose, without over powering it's malt character. \r\nOur favorite review \"This tastes like beer\".", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Rat Bastard Pale Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/X3Ll4D/upload_W0IqFa-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/X3Ll4D/upload_W0IqFa-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/X3Ll4D/upload_W0IqFa-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
