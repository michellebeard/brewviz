We truly believe you should follow your passion and enjoy life. How better to do that than open Thirsty Planet Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nOur purpose then morphs into doing the right thing. For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing. A portion of our Yellow Armadillo Wheat sales will go to a local cancer research/support foundation, and a portion of our Thirsty Goat Amber sales will go to help purchase farm animals (maybe goats?) for needy people in third world countries.

The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you \u2013 the fan of COOP Ale Works \u2013 will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own.

This top-fermented, unfiltered Wheat Bock beer is the counterpart to Bayern\u2019s famous Doppelbock Lager and is decoction-brewed, a technique used often in Bavaria but seldom in the US. The recipe uses five types of malt (Wheat, Pilsener, Carmel, Munich and Chocolate), and has an o.g. of  17 % Plato, producing a stout 7.5 % Alc. by Vol. As with all Bayern wheat beers, Face Plant surprises with its complex flavor. German Hallertauer Perle hops give this hearty Bock beer a perfectly balanced sweetness.\r\n The formulation for this delicate beer came from the Brauerei zum Schiff in Kaufbeuren, Bavaria. Bayern Brewing\u2019s proprietor, J\u00fcrgen Kn\u00f6ller, was one of the last of five brewers that brewed this special beer in 1979 before the brewery, which was founded in 1540, sadly closed its doors due to the owner\u2019s passing. \r\n In fall of 2007, when it became apparent that the crisis of extremely high raw material prices would continue, the Bayern team decided to test the market with a brew that uses a very large amount of energy and raw materials while being the most difficult, labor-intensive, demanding beer that anyone could create. We told our distributors that we would do two brews at 1000 gallons each to see whether the market could handle the premium price that we had to charge due to these factors. \r\n Our \"Super Brew\" lasted only a couple of months and then completely sold out. \r\n So Bayern Brewing continues to brew Face Plant while its popularity continues to grow. Thus Doppelweizen has been revived here in Missoula, Montana, USA. We hope you will enjoy a piece of living beer history and a specialty beer that is truly rare, even in the Northwest\u2019s highly diversified beer landscape.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Face Plant Doppelweizen", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/IJCPu1/upload_gjWwg1-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/IJCPu1/upload_gjWwg1-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/IJCPu1/upload_gjWwg1-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 4, "name": "German Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.048", "description": "This beer style is characterized by a distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt.
