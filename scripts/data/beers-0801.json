Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles.

While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage \u2014 an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-04-08 13:11:43", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "Zhydrx", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Vista", "createDate": "2014-04-08 13:13:42", "streetAddress": "2545 Progress Street", "postalCode": "92081", "extendedAddress": "Suite D", "website": "http://boozebrothersbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(760) 295-0217", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.148172, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.218047, "updateDate": "2015-08-26 16:23:19", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Booze Brothers", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:53:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-icon.png"}, "id": "xaBLno", "name": "Booze Brothers Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant.

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

Native American tribes used this symbol to represent the bringing together of two clans. In essence Friendship.\r\n\r\nOur beer honors this standard as well; embracing our sense of place here in the Carolinas and the diversity and warmth and pride of home from this unique neighborhood.  We are driven to push the boundaries of making innovative brews that taste of those influences. We do this using seasonally available, local Carolina and American ingredients in both traditional and innovative ways.\r\n\r\nAt our core, every member of Legion Brewing recognizes that none of us got where we are today on our own.
