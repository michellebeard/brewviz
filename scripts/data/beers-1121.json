The brothers agreed to a partnership for 15 years. At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and, it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth. Edward's son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbach's until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "jH1IY7", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Roeselare", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "streetAddress": "Spanjestraat 133-141", "latitude": 50.9460157, "website": "http://www.rodenbach.be/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1821", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "phone": "32-051-27-28-10", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "West-Vlaanderen", "longitude": 3.1375433, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brouwerij Rodenbach", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:41:57", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_QDpp99-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_QDpp99-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_QDpp99-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_QDpp99-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_QDpp99-icon.png"}, "id": "qZJOHj", "name": "Brouwerij Rodenbach"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "This light- to medium-bodied deep copper to brown ale is characterized by a slight to strong lactic sourness, and with \"Reds\" sometimes a balanced degree of acetic acid.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.
