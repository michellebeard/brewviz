You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2/3\u2019s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer.
