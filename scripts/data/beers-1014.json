We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used.

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing.

This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area.

cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast. Black to very deep ruby/garnet in color. Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "35", "categoryId": 9, "srmMax": "40", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "7.5", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:41:46", "fgMax": "1.022", "shortName": "Baltic Porter", "abvMax": "9", "id": 104, "srmMin": "40", "name": "Baltic-Style Porter"}, "createDate": "2012-08-12 12:11:05", "updateDate": "2015-02-05 15:11:06", "abv": "7.5", "styleId": 104, "availableId": 1, "id": "cFATq0", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "St\u00f6rtebeker St\u00f6rtebeker Bernsteinweizen", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.stralsunder.de/", "established": "1827", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "St\u00f6rtebeker Braumanufaktur GmbH", "createDate": "2012-08-07 10:18:17", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Hansestadt Stralsund", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2012-08-16 15:14:10", "longitude": 13.094093, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 54.290818, "streetAddress": "Greifswalder Chaussee 84-85", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "postalCode": "18439", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "564ZPt", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "St\u00f6rtebeker Braumanufaktur GmbH", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:33:01", "id": "1P45iR", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "createDate": "2012-08-12 12:10:58", "updateDate": "2012-08-17 17:49:28", "id": "CQUm0m", "name": "St\u00f6rtebeker St\u00f6rtebeker Bernsteinweizen"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "St\u00f6rtebeker St\u00f6rtebeker Bio - Bernsteinweizen", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.stralsunder.de/", "established": "1827", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "St\u00f6rtebeker Braumanufaktur GmbH", "createDate": "2012-08-07 10:18:17", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Hansestadt Stralsund", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2012-08-16 15:14:10", "longitude": 13.094093, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 54.290818, "streetAddress": "Greifswalder Chaussee 84-85", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "postalCode": "18439", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "564ZPt", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "St\u00f6rtebeker Braumanufaktur GmbH", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:33:01", "id": "1P45iR", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "createDate": "2012-08-12 12:11:02", "updateDate": "2012-08-17 17:49:36", "id": "uKpcvO", "name": "St\u00f6rtebeker St\u00f6rtebeker Bio - Bernsteinweizen"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "St\u00f6rtebeker St\u00f6rtebeker Bio - Bernsteinweizen alkoholfrei", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.stralsunder.de/", "established": "1827", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "St\u00f6rtebeker Braumanufaktur GmbH", "createDate": "2012-08-07 10:18:17", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "DE", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Hansestadt Stralsund", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2012-08-16 15:14:10", "longitude": 13.094093, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 54.290818, "streetAddress": "Greifswalder Chaussee 84-85", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Germany", "name": "GERMANY", "isoThree": "DEU", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 276, "isoCode": "DE"}, "postalCode": "18439", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "564ZPt", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "St\u00f6rtebeker Braumanufaktur GmbH", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:33:01", "id": "1P45iR", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "createDate": "2012-08-12 12:11:00", "updateDate": "2012-08-17 17:49:33", "id": "3NfCT5", "name": "St\u00f6rtebeker St\u00f6rtebeker Bio - Bernsteinweizen alkoholfrei"}]
