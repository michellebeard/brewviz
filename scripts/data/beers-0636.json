We brew this beer during the very small window of time when the apricots are at their peak of freshness, usually early July. The pureed apricots add a wonderful fruit flavor to the beer and combine with the wheat for a refreshing tart finish. This beer goes down smooth, but at over 1.5 times the alcohol of the Orange Wheat, it will sneak up on you.\r\n\r\nThe name Polycot (Poly=Many cot=Apricot) is a modification of the original name Paulycot. Paul-yicot was named for owner Ben Cook\u2019s friend Paul who provided the apricots for the initial batch. Hangar 24 would also like to acknowledge and thank the many volunteers who spend hours pitting (and de-stickering) thousands of apricots for the brew.
