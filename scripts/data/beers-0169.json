Having selected single barrels of bourbon which were then bottled for exclusive use at Legal Sea Foods restaurants, the empty barrels were shared with us here at CBC in order to produce this beer.  \r\nThis Dry Stout was crafted from roasted barley and oats plus pale, chocolate, and amber malts from the Fawcett Maltings in Yorkshire, England. Gently hopped with English Fuggles hops, after fermentation it was laid to rest for four months in a dozen oak barrels which had previously held bourbon from Buffalo Trace distillery and others.\r\n\r\nThe resulting beer offers an aroma of roasted cereals and hints of espresso with a touch of oak-derived vanillins. On the palate, Boilermaker Stout is very dry and quaffable with caramel and roasty notes balanced by flavors from the charred oak barrels, and a subtle hint of spirit lingering in its very smooth finish.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "ingredients": {"hops": [{"alphaAcidMax": 3, "myrceneMax": 28, "farneseneMax": 7, "cohumuloneMax": 30, "id": 1985, "humuleneMax": 39, "category": "hop", "createDate": "2013-06-24 16:10:37", "farneseneMin": 5, "humuleneMin": 30, "betaAcidMax": 3.1, "cohumuloneMin": 25, "myrceneMin": 24, "alphaAcidMin": 3, "description": "Fuggle is an English hop cultivar.

Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:27", "shortName": "BBL Aged", "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "createDate": "2014-01-31 13:30:12", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 09:27:19", "abv": "16.2", "styleId": 132, "id": "C0iapM", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Light golden in color, crisp, smooth and dry with slight bitterness to balance the sweetness of the malt.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile.
