We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Tasting Room & Store Hours\r\nMonday-Friday, 11:00-7:00\r\nSaturday-Sunday, 10:00-5:00", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "id": "PckBjw", "streetAddress": "5401 Linda Vista Road", "postalCode": "92110", "extendedAddress": "#406", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(619) 295-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Home Brew Mart", "latitude": 32.7667586, "locationType": "tasting", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1952129, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:33:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "a7VHpi", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2012-12-07 00:05:42", "streetAddress": "10051 Old Grove Rd", "postalCode": "92131", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(858) 695-2739", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Scripps Ranch Brewery", "latitude": 32.898466, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.110794, "updateDate": "2015-06-11 14:39:57", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:03:59", "id": "cLcfTf", "streetAddress": "2215 India St", "postalCode": "92101", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(619) 255-7213", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Tasting Room & Kitchen", "latitude": 32.7277143, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1697202, "updateDate": "2015-06-11 13:48:56", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "1zYgG4", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2015-06-09 16:08:18", "streetAddress": "9045 Carroll Way", "postalCode": "92121", "website": "http://www.ballastpoint.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2014", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "8587906900", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Miramar", "latitude": 32.8881618, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1580141, "updateDate": "2016-09-20 15:35:53", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon\u2013Sat 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSunday 11:00am\u20139:00pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "San Diego", "createDate": "2015-06-09 20:31:45", "id": "gRg0OA", "streetAddress": "9045 Carroll Way", "postalCode": "92121", "website": "www.ballastpoint.com", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "8587906900", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 32.8881618, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.1580141, "updateDate": "2015-06-16 14:59:48", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "kr3KqQ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Long Beach", "createDate": "2016-06-21 19:31:36", "streetAddress": "110 N.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries.

We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.
