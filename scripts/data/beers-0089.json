Smoke character is not harshly phenolic, but rather very smooth, almost rendering a perception of mild sweetness to this style of beer.

This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness. Certain renditions of this beer style approach a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity.

Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-05-07 17:45:28", "locations": [{"website": "http://brewage.at/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "1060 Wien", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2016-05-07 17:50:12", "countryIsoCode": "AT", "longitude": 16.3434939, "hoursOfOperation": "Tue:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nWed:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nThu:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n", "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+43 1 9550935", "streetAddress": "Mittelgasse 4", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-05-07 17:50:12", "country": {"displayName": "Austria", "name": "AUSTRIA", "isoThree": "AUT", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 40, "isoCode": "AT"}, "latitude": 48.1939642, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "mMnrjZ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brew Age", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-05-07 18:30:52", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png"}, "id": "Y2gEyS", "name": "Brew Age"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.
