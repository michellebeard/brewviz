We will strive to be a gathering place for beer lovers and support bicycling as a great way to get around our beautiful city.\r\n\r\nPeddler Brewing Company has a 7-barrel brewing system which means it can pump out up to 14 kegs of beer per batch. We plan to have 8 taps in our tap room with a few regular taps and a couple rotating seasonal taps. We also plan to have a guest tap or two of other WA state brews or ciders. Our indoor space will have a large bar and tables for guests to sit back and enjoy a taster tray or a pint. We will also have a growler and 32oz bottle exchange to take beer home, with a small deposit encouraging the return and re-use of bottles/growlers.\r\n\r\nDecide to ride your bike to our brewery? Perfect! We have an indoor bike rack that holds 9 bicycles and will have a bike work station for you to do some tune-ups, pump up your tire, or easily fix that flat.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:55", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Frederick", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:55", "id": "EPqUQP", "streetAddress": "4607 Wedgewood Blvd", "postalCode": "21703", "website": "http://www.flyingdogales.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1983", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "301-694-7899", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.361926, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Maryland", "longitude": -77.424677, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Flying Dog", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:46:05", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png"}, "id": "jmGoBA", "name": "Flying Dog Brewery"}], "name": "Coffee Stout (Batch 2)", "nameDisplay": "Coffee Stout (Batch 2)", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/TUwrYJ/upload_9p3ubs-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/TUwrYJ/upload_9p3ubs-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/TUwrYJ/upload_9p3ubs-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.
