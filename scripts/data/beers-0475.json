A supporter of Temperance, Dr. Welch promoted Concord in 1869 as a non-alc for communion at his church in Vineland, NJ - the future home to a Manischewitz plant for delights such as borscht & gefilte fish. Sammy Davis Jr. for Cream White Concord: \"Man-oh-Manischewitz.\" Fictitious indie amateur, Miles Raymond from Sideways single-handedly created a backlash and a glut of Merlot in the US wine market. Genesis (9:20-21) the 1st reference to wine in the Torah: \"Noah planted a vineyard: And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.\" Scholars suggest the story of Jesus turning water into wine was intended to show his superiority to Dionysus the Greek god of wine. Houdini performed a trick of holding a glass of water, turning it to wine, and then pulling from it silk scarves and an eagle.
