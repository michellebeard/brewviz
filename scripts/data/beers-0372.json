Session IPAs are lighter bodied and lighter in alcohol than a normal American IPA. Hop, and bitterness is used in beer to balance the alcohol. In a beer with a lower abv, the IBU must be lower as well in order for the beer to maintain its balance. In a session IPA very little bittering hop is used. Hops are added very late in the brewing process to create a strong aroma and flavour profile.

The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school.
