As he admires the bountiful works of art, he settles into a calming bliss that leads effortlessly into a trance-like state of utter tranquility.  His mind expands as he strolls and peruses the masterpieces before him.  In time, he is lured to a painting that quietly yet assuredly speaks to him and, posthaste, he becomes infatuated with its display of simplicity coexisting with great detail.  What better artist to settle on but one whose vision evoked the same response from great masters such as Matisse and Picasso, who remarked that Paul C\u00e9zanne \u201cis the father of us all\u201d.  Still life artwork was prevalent in this French Post-Impressionist painter\u2019s repertoire.  The result of this inspiration is a Saison that blends a classic Saison DuPont yeast with yellow peaches added during fermentation.

Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:30:28", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Traverse City", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:32:00", "id": "1QFuku", "streetAddress": "2959 Hartman Rd", "postalCode": "49685", "website": "http://www.breweryterrafirma.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(231) 929-1600", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.7154521, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -85.6354376, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:36:47", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brewery Terra Firma", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-10-19 18:22:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-icon.png"}, "id": "dvuEzd", "name": "Brewery Terra Firma"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.05", "description": "Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "HeStKS", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Potosi", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "streetAddress": "209 South Main Street", "postalCode": "53820", "extendedAddress": "Box 177", "website": "http://www.potosibrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1852", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-763-4002", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.6716654, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -90.7271709, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Potosi", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-24 17:44:52", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png"}, "id": "Q4eTmd", "name": "Potosi Brewing Company"}], "description": "A seasonal favorite!

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "100", "ibuMax": "100", "abvMin": "2.5", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:44:53", "fgMax": "1.03", "shortName": "Specialty", "abvMax": "25", "id": 125, "srmMin": "1", "name": "Specialty Beer"}, "id": "vJqiY8", "createDate": "2015-12-02 20:25:12", "updateDate": "2015-12-02 20:25:12", "abv": "8.5", "styleId": 125, "ibu": "60", "name": "Stochasticity Project: Grainiac"}]
