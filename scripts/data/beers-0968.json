Sleeman arrived in Ontario from Cornwall, England. By 1851, he started the first Sleeman brewery to be located in Guelph, Ontario, brewing small 100-barrel batches. \r\n\r\nThe passion that drove John's great-great-grandfather to begin his renowned Canadian brewing tradition is the same passion that runs through John's veins today - and we look forward to passing on the tradition to many more generations to come.\r\n\r\nAn art as much as a science, beer making depends equally on the talent of the brewmaster and the quality of the ingredients. \r\n\r\nPremium brewing employs a time-honoured process in which natural ingredients are blended in myriad combinations and brewed in small batches to produce beers that range from contemporary light brews to 'Old World' dark stouts.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Guelph", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ontario", "longitude": -80.2067709, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "1-519-822-1834", "streetAddress": "551 Clair Road West", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}, "latitude": 43.4870365, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "q878Wn", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Sleeman Breweries Ltd.", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:58:18", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_y0NF7M-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_y0NF7M-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_y0NF7M-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_y0NF7M-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_y0NF7M-icon.png"}, "id": "D61TcY", "name": "Sleeman Breweries Ltd."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "Mild, pale, light-bodied ale, made using a warm fermentation (top or bottom) and cold lagering.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not.
