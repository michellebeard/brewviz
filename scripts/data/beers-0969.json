They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Paddleboard Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They brew many seasonals throughout the year including: Snow Park XPA, Slippery Slope, Skookum Creek Ale, Paulina Lake Pilsner, Waste Deep Weiss, Riverside Red, Silverback Imperial Stout, Kolsch, IRA, etc. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery store.\r\n\r\nPHIL BREY \u2013 HEAD BREWER\r\nPhil brings 25 years of winemaking and brewing experience to Cascade Lakes Brewing Co. Phil started home brewing in college while working on his degree in Enology (winemaking) at Fresno State. Phil started with some winemaking stints in California at Mirassou Winery and Bogle Vineyards before moving to Bend. He began his professional brewing career at Deschutes Brewery. After some time over in the valley making wine at Benton-Lane Winery and Spindrift Cellars, and brewing at Oregon Trail Brewery, Phil returned to the High Desert to brew at Cascade Lakes, where he has worked since 2010.

A small, windowless apartment where Matt would brew beer by day and sleep on the floor by night, with lamps on timers to remind him when wake up and do it all over again.\r\nPhillips\u2019 first brews were about as unconventional as his financing structure.  In the conservative beer climate of 2001 the brewery launched with an Espresso Stout, a Raspberry Wheat Ale, and a boldy-hopped IPA;  a suitable foreshadow for the creativity to come.\r\nSince then Phillips has moved out of the apartment and into a more brewing-appropriate facility (with windows) closer to town.  We have launched a soda company, a distillery, and most recently a malting facility\u2013the only one of its kind in Canada.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "HeStKS", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Potosi", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "streetAddress": "209 South Main Street", "postalCode": "53820", "extendedAddress": "Box 177", "website": "http://www.potosibrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1852", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-763-4002", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.6716654, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -90.7271709, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Potosi", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-24 17:44:52", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png"}, "id": "Q4eTmd", "name": "Potosi Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.08", "description": "Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.
