This clever idea produced 26 different beers ranging widely in taste, complexity, and lack of sleep for our brewers! We traveled through the alphabet, with no shortcuts, starting with Alyssa and now introducing, the last letter \u2018Z\u2019 for Zach, an imperial oatmeal stout. Cyclone Zach is an intense beer, both in its brewing and flavor profile. Six mashes, rather than the usual two, were required to create this brew, leading to round the clock brewing. Boasting a 10.1% ABV Zach is truly a big and bold beer, but his most important characteristic is smoothness. To create Zach\u2019s silky smooth flavor, the brewers combined extra tank conditioning time with the addition of the most flaked oat ever used in a Storm brew, to balance the otherwise over intense roasted backbone of the beer.
