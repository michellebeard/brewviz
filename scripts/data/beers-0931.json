At Brothers Drake, our philosophy on making mead is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\n1. Start Local: We buy local honey, support local agriculture, and produce a local product.\r\n\r\n2. Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices. We look forward to sharing a drink with you!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:48", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "0Y6wSh", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Columbus", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:48", "streetAddress": "26 E. 5th Avenue", "postalCode": "43201", "website": "http://brothersdrake.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "614-388-8765", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.987311, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -83.004595, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brothers Drake Meadery", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:11:09", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_g95Ivt-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_g95Ivt-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_g95Ivt-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_g95Ivt-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_g95Ivt-icon.png"}, "id": "IEFRaK", "name": "Brothers Drake Meadery"}], "description": "Brad the Beekeeper gave us a huge 55-gallon drum of his fresh wildflower honey to cast this mead on the summer solstice - the actual solstice, which is June 21st.

Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals.
