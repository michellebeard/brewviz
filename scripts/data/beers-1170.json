Our premises have also been used for storing bibles, hence reigns an atmosphere of divine tranquillity only otherwise found in Belgian monasteries. Well...\r\n \r\nFounders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.\r\n \r\nIt is our ambition to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible flavours and aromas.\r\n \r\nWe allow the beer to mature completely in the bottle before releasing it to the market. This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed beer from Amager Bryghus.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-03-06 18:54:21", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.amagerbryghus.dk/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 55.624252, "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Kastrup", "countryIsoCode": "DK", "longitude": 12.595661, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+45 32 50 62 00 \u200e", "streetAddress": "Fugleb\u00e6kvej 2 C", "createDate": "2012-03-06 18:55:10", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Denmark", "name": "DENMARK", "isoThree": "DNK", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 208, "isoCode": "DK"}, "postalCode": "2770", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "8tHhXL", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Amager Bryghus", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:28:23", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_4EzywV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_4EzywV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_4EzywV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_4EzywV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_4EzywV-icon.png"}, "id": "LOKnrY", "name": "Amager Bryghus"}], "description": "This Wookiee IPA is a collaborative brew with California Port Brewings brewer Mike Rodriguez and founder and head brewer Tom Arthur, who was a walk in Denmark on 9 March 2011.\n \nIt is a true American West Coast IPA, which is not spared humlerne.\n \nAnd there is no jantelov when we say that we are proud of this beer!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Wookiee IPA", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/fR9hRS/upload_3KS7jt-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/fR9hRS/upload_3KS7jt-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/fR9hRS/upload_3KS7jt-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof).

However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Fridays 3pm - 7pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Centralia", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "id": "TkT8Rc", "streetAddress": "5945 Prather Road", "postalCode": "98531", "website": "http://dicksbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-586-7760", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 46.771347, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -123.007543, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Dick's", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:44:31", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-icon.png"}, "id": "GC3a1f", "name": "Dick's Brewing Company"}], "name": "Working Man's Brown Ale", "nameDisplay": "Working Man's Brown Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/dESON1/upload_MIdiVa-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/dESON1/upload_MIdiVa-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/dESON1/upload_MIdiVa-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

That's the quest. We're a long ways from realizing this vision, but we hope you enjoy the adventure as much as we expect to. Interested?

It is a solar festival, observed when the length of night and day (on the equator, at least) are equal, striking a perfect balance between dark and light. Workingman\u2019s Red is an exceptional beer for the occasion, since its reddish hue strikes a perfect balance between the darker beers of winter and the lighter beers of summer. Its flavor is also perfectly balanced between the sweetness derived from malted barley and the bitterness derived from whole hop cones.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Red style was first brewed in Ireland by Franciscan monks sometime in the 14th century, which was long before stout became the national drink. The use of unmalted roasted barley reflected the Irish tradition of dodging British-imposed malt taxes while adding depth and complexity to the ale's character. It gained appeal as a restorative brew to slake the thirsts of farm hands at harvest time and, later, industrial workers after a day in the factory. An exceptionally drinkable quality characterized this ale. The same can be said for Workingman\u2019s Red, which has a deep mahogany color and a slight, malty sweetness up front. This rich foundation and flavor is surprisingly smooth due to the perfect balance of noble hop flavors. It finishes with a toasty mouth feel and a bold, aromatic hop character that compliments the up front sweetness exquisitely.\r\n\r\nWorkingman\u2019s Red is flavorful enough to satisfy discerning tastes, but still quaffable enough to quench the mighty thirst of the workingman.

Read more about these \"standards\" and dozens of others, including our beloved seasonal ales.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical.
