After experiencing the first IPA in the series, one customer's email remarked, \"You'd better not leave me sitting here in Limbo until you decide to brew some of your new IPA's year-round.\" And so became Limbo.\r\n\r\nAt 80 IBU's, we knew this Australian & West Coast hopped IPA warranted packaging that was equally as bold, so we broke the Long Trail mold and went to some unchartered territory. The package graphics and tap handles are like nothing we have ever done before and are sure to turn some heads. Limbo six packs will have a special die-cut design to showcase the artwork.
