The first beer out of our new brewhouse is Brooklyn Main Engine Start, a burnishedgold ale in the rare \u201cAbbey Singel\u201d style, reminiscent of the un-filtered beers that Trappist monks make for themselves. It\u2019s dry and biscuity on the palate, with a lilt of spicy Belgian yeast character and a snappy hop bite. Judicious dry hopping with Slovenian Aurora hops lends an appetizing herbal note. It\u2019s tasty enough to stick with for the whole evening, and at about 6% ABV, it won\u2019t have you tripping over snow banks after just one.\r\nWe know it\u2019s winter and you might have been expecting something heavy and dark, but right now we\u2019re just not in a heavy and dark mood. In fact, we\u2019re feeling pretty cheerful, and we want to celebrate with a bunch of our friends and a few pints of beer. If you\u2019re in the neighborhood, stop by during our tour hours and see the new brewery. If you\u2019ve seen the brewery before, you\u2019ll be amazed what we\u2019ve done with the place. It\u2019s cold outside \u2013 stay a while.
