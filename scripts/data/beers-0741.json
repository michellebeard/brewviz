Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.

Are you asking yourself, \u201cWhat the hell are they talking about?\u201d\r\n\r\nprocessIt goes like this. British monks loved to put their bald heads together, eat gruel and make killer good beer. Let\u2019s face it. This was the Middle Ages, the insulation in those drafty monasteries sucked, so beer making kept them busy, and after a few pints, who gave a damn about the cold.\r\n\r\nBut these dudes were on to something. Using only barley, wheat, hops and pure water and being tight-assed about things like purity (they were monks after-all), they developed a system for making beer that has stood the test of time. And you thought ancient purity laws has something to do with chastity.\r\n\r\nThat same British monk-inspired beer yeast begat yeast off-spring. It is from this very same yeast that we make our beers. How\u2019s that for a DNA profile?\r\n\r\nBut we\u2019ve taken things a step further. We use the Peter Austin Brick Kettle Brewing System. For you non-beer geeks Peter Austin was The Granddaddy High Brew Master of Microbrewing. This was the man who started it all.\r\n\r\nThe Peter Austin system is a direct-fired, brick clad, copper whirlpool and hop percolator, and you cannot buy it at Costco when you get a Vitamix. The Austin system is a rugged, reliable and easy to operate, clean and maintain.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 100 Peter Austin Brewing Systems installed worldwide, but Four Mile Brewery is the only brewery in Western North America using his system.\r\n\r\nAlthough Peter Austin has left this mortal coil for a beer garden in the sky, his gifted prot\u00e9g\u00e9 carries on his vision.\r\n\r\nAlan Pugsley is our Brew Master at Four Mile. Pugsley is not just our brew master. He travels around waving his frothy magic wand amongst all his other projects around the world. What is distinctive to Alan\u2019s process is his know-how when developing beer recipes. His recipes honour true British beer making while masterfully tweaking things to incorporate regional ingredients while developing taste profiles that appeal to local palates.\r\n\r\nAs Peter Austin taught Alan Pugsley, so too did Pugsley teach our own resident brewer, Doug White. White is part of the family clan at Four Mile. In 1985 he headed off on a beer quest walk-about.\r\n\r\nHe got as far as England, Ringwood Brewery and Alan Pugsley. He apprenticed with them, and then, upon his return, took further training the University of California, David Campus, in brewing sciences. For White, craft brewing is a hands-on art form, and the proof, dear drinker, can be worshipped from dainty sip to gusto guzzle.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-01-10 03:06:20", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Victoria", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "British Columbia", "longitude": -123.4345587, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+1 250-479-3346", "streetAddress": "199 Island Highway", "createDate": "2015-01-11 03:32:14", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-11-20 16:09:42", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}, "postalCode": "BC V9B 1G1", "latitude": 48.4526413, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "E8QMCs", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "4 Mile", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:03:31", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GSkOGp/upload_XzTGhh-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GSkOGp/upload_XzTGhh-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GSkOGp/upload_XzTGhh-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GSkOGp/upload_XzTGhh-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GSkOGp/upload_XzTGhh-icon.png"}, "id": "GSkOGp", "name": "4 Mile Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.038", "description": "Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.
