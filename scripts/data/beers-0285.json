Having been to Belgium, we have to agree \u2013 we can lump some beers together by type, but Belgian brewing has a sort of wooly individuality that we admire. We are surely telling the truth if we say that British and Irish dark beers tend to be colored and flavored by roasted malts. And it\u2019s equally true to say that Belgian dark beers tend to be colored and flavored with caramelized sugar syrup, giving them a very different set of flavors from their cousins across the Channel.\r\nWell, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. We love our Belgian yeasts and we also love stout, so you knew this would happen eventually. Brooklyn Cuv\u00e9e Noire starts with a solid base of German malts, builds color and flavor from British and American roasted malts, gains rum notes from Mauritius raw sugar, grabs a hint of citrus from sweet orange peel, and then ferments under the flag of Belgium. Our Belgian house yeast lends the beer a gentle spiciness on a dry, brisk palate displaying light notes of chocolate, coffee and citrus, all underneath a fluffy tan head. The finish is clean and dry. Cuv\u00e9e Noire is big enough to take a steak to dinner, roasty enough to love Mexican mol\u00e9 sauce, and complex enough to enjoy with nothing more than a good conversation.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the style thing, well, we\u2019ll all just have to relax about this one. I mean, we\u2019re not even sure that Belgium even has a government right now, and they don\u2019t seem to be worrying much about it. So have yourself a Brooklyn Cuv\u00e9e Noire.

Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

During his college days the head brewer, Derek Luke, reaquired a homebrewing kit he had given his sister and quickly went to work brewing and passing his knowledge along to the company's president, Brent Ryan. As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The Man\". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves. Since then we have expanded our product line and our distribution territory but continue to brew up a storm in our Middletown Brewery.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:51", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "oz1oll", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Middletown", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:51", "streetAddress": "307 Oliphant Lane", "postalCode": "02842", "website": "http://www.newportstorm.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1999", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "401-849-5232", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.5369904, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Rhode Island", "longitude": -71.2796012, "updateDate": "2014-09-26 13:18:19", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Coastal Extreme", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:43:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_FchmX0-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_FchmX0-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_FchmX0-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_FchmX0-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_FchmX0-icon.png"}, "id": "IphbdN", "name": "Coastal Extreme Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.08", "description": "Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Paddleboard Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They brew many seasonals throughout the year including: Snow Park XPA, Slippery Slope, Skookum Creek Ale, Paulina Lake Pilsner, Waste Deep Weiss, Riverside Red, Silverback Imperial Stout, Kolsch, IRA, etc. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery store.\r\n\r\nPHIL BREY \u2013 HEAD BREWER\r\nPhil brings 25 years of winemaking and brewing experience to Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.
