Butchers, bakers, farmers and even brewers, made their products for local consumption.\r\n\r\nFounded in 2009, Draai Laag began as a way to introduce beer with creative flavors into the market, offering a bit of variety in a world of Pilsners, Pales Ales and Porters.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we use old world methods, such as bottle conditioning by aging our ales on lees.  We brew in small batches and use several strains of yeast to produce our beers.   The drinker may notice slight nuances from batch to batch.  But, you will find that all our ales are aged and, just like a fine wine, can be laid down for extended periods.   This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.\r\n\r\nThis company was built on the dream of doing what we love and following our passion.  For those who understand us, we thank you and hope you enjoy what we have to contribute.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-02-27 13:08:37", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.draailaag.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Millvale", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Pennsylvania", "countryIsoCode": "US", "longitude": -79.968181, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 40.4787751, "streetAddress": "501 East Ohio Street", "createDate": "2014-02-27 13:09:32", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-12-04 15:59:36", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "15209", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "DXRyuX", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Draai Laag", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:51:41", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vdiLuR/upload_Z7Vqqh-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vdiLuR/upload_Z7Vqqh-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vdiLuR/upload_Z7Vqqh-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vdiLuR/upload_Z7Vqqh-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vdiLuR/upload_Z7Vqqh-icon.png"}, "id": "vdiLuR", "name": "Draai Laag Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "description": "Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style.

The family has since expanded with the addition of two daughters-in-law -- Talar and Rachel -- and grandson's Nico (so much for that \"D\" thing!) and Dillon. We've always been a very close family and love doing things together whether it's vacations, home improvement projects, sporting events, or just hanging out. We've long had a dream of starting our own business, and so we finally decided to take our love of craft beer, combined with our home-brewing experience, to create Four Sons Brewing. The picture below is a shot of the whole group and when you visit our tasting room you will likely see most (if not all) of us there. (Oh, by the way, we are huge LA Kings fans!).
