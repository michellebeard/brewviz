This red ale is our unique version of a northern German Alt-Bier. Enjoy silky caramel smoothness, followed by toasty, bready flavors and finished with a hint of chocolate roast. These flavors all come through in the aroma and combine in a truly unique, very clean, complex, Alt-Bier.\r\n\r\nOur Alt-Bier is very traditional except for one twist, chocolate roasted malt. We decided to add the chocolate malt to add a little more complexity to the beer and for a perceived dryness that helps to balance the caramel malty flavor.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Alt-Bier Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kyuJMz/upload_5akMCv-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kyuJMz/upload_5akMCv-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/kyuJMz/upload_5akMCv-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 4, "name": "German Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "German-Style Altbiers are copper to dark brown ales, originally from the D\u00fcsseldorf area.
