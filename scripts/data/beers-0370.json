Clean, crisp and refreshing. \r\nTPA is the state\u2019s first Texas-style IPA, a sessionable and easy drinking, everyday IPA. Hoppy, clean and balanced. \r\nTwo of our SAB classics will be served at GABF this year, Six-String Saison and Crossroads Coffee Stout. Six String is our non traditional take on the Franco- Belgian style farmhouse ale. Complex flavors; Spicy, citric and funky. The Cross Roads is a coffee stout with a unique blend of roasted barley, chocolate malt and oats. Infused with fresh roasted Brazilian micro lot coffee. Big, malty, roasted flavor! \r\nThe latest addition to the line up is our Evel Ale. A Blonde All American Ale.
