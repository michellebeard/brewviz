The color will range from golden amber to deep brown Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "9", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "17", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "2.8", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:41", "fgMax": "1.012", "shortName": "Scottish Light", "abvMax": "3.5", "id": 7, "srmMin": "8", "name": "Scottish-Style Light Ale"}, "id": "uf5uHx", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Brewed every year for the Pemaquid Oyster Festival in Damariscotta, this riich, chocolatey brew benefits from having ten dozen live oysters involved in the beer....mmmm oysters.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Pemaquid Oyster Stout", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.08", "description": "See British Origin American-Style Imperial Porter Imperial porters are very dark brown to black in color.
