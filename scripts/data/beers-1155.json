This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties).

Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the \u2018Port Melbourne Brewing Co\u2019 operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.\r\n \r\nIn 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family \u2013 an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.\r\n \r\nIn 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant \u2013 so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.\r\n \r\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve produced some of Australia\u2019s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards.
