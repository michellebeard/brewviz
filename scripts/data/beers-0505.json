The first brewery on the \u00c5land islands was established back in the 1850's, but Stallhagen is now \u00c5land's only brewery, with a production site at Grelsby, 18 km from Mariehamn.\r\n\r\nThe initial aim of the brewery was to produce good craft beers, mainly for the \u00c5land market. However, with its flavorful products the company has quickly won innumerable friends outside \u00c5land, and Stallhagen beer is now sold in both Finland and Sweden. Steadily increasing demand and investments in higher production capacity have led to a growth in sales volumes and made the Stallhagen brand well-known to beer-lovers generally, not just the growing flock of experts and connoisseurs.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-09-22 21:58:03", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "FI", "name": "Main Brewery", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Godby", "longitude": 19.9879698, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 60.2299259, "streetAddress": "Getav\u00e4gen 196", "createDate": "2015-09-30 15:12:07", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-09-30 15:12:07", "country": {"displayName": "Finland", "name": "FINLAND", "isoThree": "FIN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 246, "isoCode": "FI"}, "postalCode": "22410", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "SffK5k", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Stallhagen", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:16:46", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FrIEDm/upload_TpB4HJ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FrIEDm/upload_TpB4HJ-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FrIEDm/upload_TpB4HJ-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FrIEDm/upload_TpB4HJ-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FrIEDm/upload_TpB4HJ-icon.png"}, "id": "FrIEDm", "name": "Stallhagen"}], "name": "Honey Beer", "nameDisplay": "Honey Beer", "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cool - (8-12C/45-54F)", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "These beers are brewed using honey in addition to malted barley.

While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s.

Sleeman arrived in Ontario from Cornwall, England. By 1851, he started the first Sleeman brewery to be located in Guelph, Ontario, brewing small 100-barrel batches. \r\n\r\nThe passion that drove John's great-great-grandfather to begin his renowned Canadian brewing tradition is the same passion that runs through John's veins today - and we look forward to passing on the tradition to many more generations to come.\r\n\r\nAn art as much as a science, beer making depends equally on the talent of the brewmaster and the quality of the ingredients. \r\n\r\nPremium brewing employs a time-honoured process in which natural ingredients are blended in myriad combinations and brewed in small batches to produce beers that range from contemporary light brews to 'Old World' dark stouts.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Guelph", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ontario", "longitude": -80.2067709, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "1-519-822-1834", "streetAddress": "551 Clair Road West", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}, "latitude": 43.4870365, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "q878Wn", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Sleeman Breweries Ltd.", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:58:18", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_y0NF7M-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_y0NF7M-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_y0NF7M-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_y0NF7M-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_y0NF7M-icon.png"}, "id": "D61TcY", "name": "Sleeman Breweries Ltd."}], "createDate": "2012-08-01 00:18:04", "updateDate": "2015-05-08 14:42:44", "abv": "5.2", "id": "3F4ty9", "name": "Honey Brown Lager"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "A fan favorite beer here at Chicago Brewing Company, this is our take on a Specialty Honey Beer.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
