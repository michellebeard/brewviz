Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer.

Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida.

The art of brewing great beer in the US without a debilitating ABV had seemed all but dead. Not anymore. Myths are simply myths, and beers of great flavor and quality have been brewed for hundreds of years in every great brewing nation except ours. Chris is not out to change the US craft beer world, but to simply brew the beers he loves to drink, and he thinks he is not alone.\r\n\r\nChris has been brewing professionally since 1993, first as an apprentice at Kennebunkport Brewing, then at the Tremont Brewery in Boston MA starting in 1994. Today, Chris is an independent brewer \u2013 he owns no facility \u2013 instead brewing and collaborating with other breweries. He currently brews his beers at two locations, the Ipswich Ale Brewery (Bottles & Draft) and Kennebunkport Brewery (Cask).", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:04", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "GDFP48", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ipswich", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:04", "streetAddress": "23 Hayward St.", "postalCode": "01938", "website": "http://www.notchsession.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2010", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "978-853-9138", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.672726, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -70.843912, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "Y", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Biergarten", "locality": "Salem", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -70.8908665, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 42.5199017, "streetAddress": "283 Derby St.", "createDate": "2016-05-25 17:13:17", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-08 19:40:12", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "01970", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "q8LO3q", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Notch", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:09:41", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a0ab7x/upload_RrMnZ9-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a0ab7x/upload_RrMnZ9-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a0ab7x/upload_RrMnZ9-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a0ab7x/upload_RrMnZ9-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a0ab7x/upload_RrMnZ9-icon.png"}, "id": "a0ab7x", "name": "Notch Brewing"}], "description": "Polotmavy is loosely translated as \"half-dark\" or amber as we know it, and is yet another style of Czech lager rarely found in the US.

By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.
