Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to \"550 degrees\"? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That\u2019s what craft beer is\u2026a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well\u2026..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.\r\n\r\nOnce NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik\u2019s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park\u2019s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers.

The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011.

Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.\r\nQuaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.\r\nWhen Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.\r\nOnce Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.\r\nCurrently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.\r\n\r\n\"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\" - William Shakespeare", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thur: 11:30am - 9pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30am - 10pm\r\nSun: 11:30am - 9pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Nashville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "id": "qZJOHj", "streetAddress": "60 Molly Ln", "postalCode": "47448", "website": "http://www.bigwoodsbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "813-988-6000", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.2079575, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -86.2484171, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Quaff On!", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-10-11 13:02:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-icon.png"}, "id": "f8oZ5j", "name": "Quaff On!
