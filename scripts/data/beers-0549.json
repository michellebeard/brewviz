This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:56", "shortName": "BBL Aged Sour", "id": 136, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer"}, "id": "uzbisB", "createDate": "2014-05-27 14:43:13", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 14:00:40", "abv": "4.5", "styleId": 136, "foodPairings": "Bright veggies, cured meats, baked desserts and Indian Summer.", "ibu": "5", "name": "Incorrigible Reserve"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "Y", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.warpedwing.com", "established": "2014", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Dayton based craft brewery committed to brewing proprietary beer styles and warped interpretations of existing styles.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-04-04 02:22:05", "mailingListUrl": "info@warpedwing.com", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed - Thu: 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Dayton", "createDate": "2014-04-04 02:25:52", "id": "Iw8VaQ", "streetAddress": "26 Wyandot Street", "postalCode": "45402", "website": "http://www.warpedwing.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2014", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(937) 222-7003", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.75973, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.185402, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Warped Wing", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:53:18", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4UcPMq/upload_gN3iiV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4UcPMq/upload_gN3iiV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4UcPMq/upload_gN3iiV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4UcPMq/upload_gN3iiV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4UcPMq/upload_gN3iiV-icon.png"}, "id": "4UcPMq", "name": "Warped Wing Brewing"}], "description": "The name, Incorruptible, was inspired by James Ritty\u2019s cash register invention in 1879 called \u201cRitty\u2019s Incorruptible Cashier\u201d.

It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe business is, since 2008, family owned following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.\r\n\r\nTheir Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further 47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is 6.6% alcohol by volume.

David's passion would continue to grow and evolve.  He learned the tradition of brewing in America.  The history of small family owned breweries that we able to serve fresh handcrafted beer to their local communities.  The fact that the these small local breweries became points of pride in the community and that the businesses would stay in the family for generations.  \r\n \r\nAn idea began to grow.  The idea that despite the brewing world we live in now with mega breweries pumping out mass marketed bland beer, that a small locally owned brewery making fresh unique beer could again be a source of pride for a community.  David dreamed of recreating this American brewing tradition and so set out on his way to do just that.\r\n \r\nDavid spent the next 7 years honing his craft.  Learning about beer styles and brewing techniques.  Winning contests with his beer and defining a unique style for quality and consistency.  In 2012 the wheels were set into motion for our brewery when David met Tyler Meusburger, a colleague with a passion for entrepreneurship and creativity.  Working together they began building a business plan and putting financing into place, and in Nov of 2013 David and Tyler brewed the first batch of beer at New American Brewing Co.\r\n \r\nWe look forward to continuing our story and living a \"New Tradition\" of American brewing.\r\n \r\nDrink American!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-07-25 14:17:39", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "ZK7bhN", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ankeny", "createDate": "2014-07-25 14:20:32", "streetAddress": "1460 NE 69th Pl Suite 67", "postalCode": "50021", "website": "http://www.newamericanbeer.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "515-250-8703", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.6863399, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Iowa", "longitude": -93.5994046, "updateDate": "2014-07-25 14:20:32", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "New American", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:56:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_95vyk6-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_95vyk6-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_95vyk6-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_95vyk6-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_95vyk6-icon.png"}, "id": "RHn3Pm", "name": "New American Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street.

Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown.

Now that our doors are open to the public, we are proud to be Mesilla's only microbrewery and gladly share our beers with the Mesilla Valley and its visitors.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-02-11 20:13:42", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:  11:30am - 10:30pm\nThu:  11:30am - 10:30pm\nFri:  11:30am - 12:00pm\nSat:  11:30am - 12:00am\nSun:  12:30pm - 8:30pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Mesilla", "createDate": "2015-02-11 20:22:58", "id": "tiRB3X", "streetAddress": "2920 Avenida de Mesilla", "postalCode": "88005", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(575) 650-2729", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 32.2716292, "locationType": "micro", "region": "New Mexico", "longitude": -106.7911459, "updateDate": "2015-02-11 20:32:31", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Spotted Dog", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:04:46", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HadszO/upload_nymARG-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HadszO/upload_nymARG-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HadszO/upload_nymARG-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HadszO/upload_nymARG-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HadszO/upload_nymARG-icon.png"}, "id": "HadszO", "name": "Spotted Dog Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
