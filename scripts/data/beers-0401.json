The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds.

They embarked on a research road trip to the \u201cbeer capitol,\u201d Denver, Colorado, for some inspiration. There, they developed the vision of Prairie Sun Brewery.\r\n\r\nAfter 19 months their vision became a reality as they took their passion and hard work, and brewed their first batch of beer on a 10-barrel system. Starting a business is no easy task\u2026starting a craft brewery is even tougher. Luckily, they were able to find most of the equipment needed to make it happen from Hogs Head Brewery in St. Albert, Alberta. In May 2013, Heather and Cameron found the perfect home at the former \u201cSaskatoon Bakery\u201d and they moved in!

The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!
