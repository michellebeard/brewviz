Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking.

All of our beers are brewed with the intention of creating something we'll enjoy drinking ourselves and, more importantly, something we're proud to put our name to. In a world of endless possibilities, we try to explore as many of them as possible, which is why to date we've brewed in excess of two hundred different beers: some of them regulars, the odd few occasionals, and far too many one-offs to remember let alone try to name!\r\nYou should be able to find our beers on offer nationwide in the kind of pubs and bars that have the freedom and willingness to stock good beer. While most of it goes into cask, you'll also find it in keg or bottle if you look in the right places.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-05-08 08:41:02", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Lawrence Hill", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "region": "Bristol", "longitude": -2.5694249, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 51.4583567, "streetAddress": "Unit 4 Lawrence Hill Industrial Park", "createDate": "2013-05-09 00:37:54", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}, "postalCode": "BS5 0EB", "extendedAddress": "Croydon Street", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "pguslr", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:30pm\n\nMon-Thu 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri 4pm-12am;\r\nSat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 12pm-10:30pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bristol", "createDate": "2013-05-09 00:40:12", "id": "S0dgvI", "streetAddress": "147 Church Rd", "postalCode": "BS5 9LA", "extendedAddress": "Redfield", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "phone": "0117 939 4079", "isClosed": "N", "name": "The Old Stillage", "latitude": 51.4586634, "locationType": "tasting", "longitude": -2.5581766, "updateDate": "2014-08-25 19:12:59", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nTue:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nWed:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  4:00pm - 10:30pm\n\nMon-Thu 12pm-2.30pm & 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri-Sat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 4pm-10:30pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bristol", "createDate": "2013-05-09 00:41:57", "id": "4KMV4j", "streetAddress": "78 Saint George's Road", "postalCode": "BS1 5UR", "extendedAddress": "Hotwells", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "phone": "0117 907 0689", "isClosed": "N", "name": "The Three Tuns", "latitude": 51.4511176, "locationType": "restaurant", "longitude": -2.6049702, "updateDate": "2014-08-25 19:13:00", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Arbor Ales", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:42:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_DEcqbY-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_DEcqbY-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_DEcqbY-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_DEcqbY-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3CT0MA/upload_DEcqbY-icon.png"}, "id": "3CT0MA", "name": "Arbor Ales"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.\r\n\r\nJoleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nThe barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a \u201cnanobrewery\u201d, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.
