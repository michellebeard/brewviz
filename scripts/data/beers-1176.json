We truly believe you should follow your passion and enjoy life. How better to do that than open Thirsty Planet Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nOur purpose then morphs into doing the right thing. For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:27", "shortName": "BBL Aged", "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.pizzaboybrewing.com", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Pizza Boy Brewing", "createDate": "2013-06-01 18:39:41", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun - Wed 11 am - 10 pm\r\nThurs - Sat 11 am - 11 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Enola", "createDate": "2013-06-01 18:41:48", "id": "QBZAUO", "streetAddress": "2240 Millenium Way", "postalCode": "17025", "website": "http://www.pizzaboybrewing.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "717-728-3840", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 40.2887287, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -76.9698583, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Pizza Boy", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:43:33", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/osLNb3/upload_aXnmYi-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/osLNb3/upload_aXnmYi-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/osLNb3/upload_aXnmYi-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/osLNb3/upload_aXnmYi-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/osLNb3/upload_aXnmYi-icon.png"}, "id": "osLNb3", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "createDate": "2014-07-10 12:56:21", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 15:17:12", "styleId": 132, "id": "fdJT3n", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Yellow Cake", "nameDisplay": "Yellow Cake", "breweries": [{"website": "http://OldSoulBrewing.com", "established": "2014", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Family owned Craft Brewery, located in the heart of Fort Myers, Florida.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-06-15 15:20:59", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nTue:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nWed:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nThu:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nFri:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  1:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  1:00pm - 9:00pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Fort Myers", "createDate": "2015-09-16 22:29:10", "id": "7d29qt", "streetAddress": "10970 S Cleveland Ave", "postalCode": "33907", "website": "http://oldsoulbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(239) 334-4334", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Old Soul Brewing Company", "latitude": 26.5805009, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Florida", "longitude": -81.874223, "updateDate": "2015-11-19 19:22:12", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Old Soul", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:10:54", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Twcu3x/upload_mBhW0h-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Twcu3x/upload_mBhW0h-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Twcu3x/upload_mBhW0h-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Twcu3x/upload_mBhW0h-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Twcu3x/upload_mBhW0h-icon.png"}, "id": "Twcu3x", "name": "Old Soul Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.\r\nQuaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.\r\nWhen Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.\r\nOnce Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.\r\nCurrently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.\r\n\r\n\"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\" - William Shakespeare", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Thur: 11:30am - 9pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30am - 10pm\r\nSun: 11:30am - 9pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Nashville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "id": "qZJOHj", "streetAddress": "60 Molly Ln", "postalCode": "47448", "website": "http://www.bigwoodsbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "813-988-6000", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.2079575, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -86.2484171, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Quaff On!", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-10-11 13:02:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/f8oZ5j/upload_Tp27HU-icon.png"}, "id": "f8oZ5j", "name": "Quaff On!

Beginning in, 2010, we decided to expand our business and our dream. This is where the 3rd, 4th, and 5th generation of Sietsema Orchards & Cider Mill hope to thrive and grow.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.
