Opened in December 2012, the original brewpub (91 Biltmore) consistently hosts 25+ beers on tap including hop-forward, West Coast-style ales, open fermented Belgians, and barrel-aged beers. With the opening of the second location, The Funkatorium, in October 2013, Wicked Weed is striving to become one of the leading producers of barrel-aged sour and wild beers in the Southeastern United States. Wicked Weed Brewing was awarded a gold medal for both 100% Brettanomyces Serenity in 2013 and Mompara Honey Ale in 2014 at the Great American Beer Festival. Wicked Weed most recently opened 50-barrel production brewery that will allow for wider distribution in the Southeast.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-06-15 13:18:30", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "90gAzo", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Asheville", "createDate": "2012-06-15 13:19:17", "streetAddress": "91 Biltmore Ave", "postalCode": "28801", "website": "http://wickedweedbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "828-575-9599", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.591695, "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -82.551084, "updateDate": "2014-09-13 12:33:11", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Funkatorium", "locality": "Asheville", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -82.5552263, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 35.589172, "streetAddress": "147 Coxe Ave.", "createDate": "2016-01-06 19:06:22", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-01-06 19:06:22", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "28801", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "T6Nn5y", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Wicked Weed", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:29:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zeWbuM/upload_hM20Nr-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zeWbuM/upload_hM20Nr-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zeWbuM/upload_hM20Nr-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zeWbuM/upload_hM20Nr-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zeWbuM/upload_hM20Nr-icon.png"}, "id": "zeWbuM", "name": "Wicked Weed Brewing Company"}], "originalGravity": "1.044", "id": "MVSPEW", "createDate": "2015-05-27 18:17:55", "updateDate": "2015-05-27 18:17:55", "abv": "5.2", "styleId": 108, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.034", "description": "Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style guidelines.
