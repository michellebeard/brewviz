Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "12", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:48", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "Scottish Heavy", "abvMax": "4", "id": 8, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Heavy Ale"}, "createDate": "2016-07-13 20:38:01", "updateDate": "2016-07-13 20:38:01", "abv": "7", "styleId": 8, "id": "Ft8EUA", "name": "Coaches and Carriages Series: Bravetart"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Rum BBL Aged with Oak Chips, Cinnamon and Vanilla.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Coaches and Carriages Series: Hollaback Hefeweizen", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.newsarumbrewing.com", "established": "2012", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Microbrewery located in downtown Salisbury NC", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-08-19 23:09:11", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "sXgFVK", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Salisbury", "createDate": "2014-08-23 16:22:56", "streetAddress": "109 North Lee Street", "postalCode": "28144", "website": "http://www.newsarumbrewing.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(704) 830-6577", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.666689, "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -80.468105, "updateDate": "2016-06-28 13:35:41", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "New Sarum", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-27 12:20:11", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kVLhDj/upload_GhdcpJ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kVLhDj/upload_GhdcpJ-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kVLhDj/upload_GhdcpJ-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kVLhDj/upload_GhdcpJ-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/kVLhDj/upload_GhdcpJ-icon.png"}, "id": "kVLhDj", "name": "New Sarum Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 4, "name": "German Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.047", "description": "The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.
