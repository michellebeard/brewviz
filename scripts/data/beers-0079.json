After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards.

The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:21:11", "fgMax": "1.028", "shortName": "Scotch Ale", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "id": "bL7eDZ", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:44", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 05:51:44", "abv": "10.2", "styleId": 15, "availableId": 2, "glasswareId": 8, "ibu": "50", "srm": {"hex": "660D00", "id": 29, "name": "29"}, "name": "Backwoods Bastard"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available at the same time of year, every year.", "id": 4, "name": "Seasonal"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.lazymagnolia.com/", "established": "2003", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Founded in September of 2003, Lazy Magnolia is Mississippi's first brewery offering locally brewed beer to Mississippians and visitors to our state at all of their favorite restaurants.

We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DF5YsC", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "streetAddress": "30 Germania Street", "postalCode": "02130", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-372-1131", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.314449, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.103365, "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "MLUbXI", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2013-08-12 13:10:57", "streetAddress": "1625 Central Parkway", "postalCode": "45214", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-412-3200", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Cincinnati", "latitude": 39.1144986, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5222061, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Production Brewery", "locality": "Breinigsville", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.6290377, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 40.5759622, "streetAddress": "7880 Penn Drive", "createDate": "2015-11-30 20:24:56", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2007", "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "postalCode": "18031", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "XZ6L8a", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Boston Beer", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:24:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png"}, "id": "1wSztN", "name": "Boston Beer Company"}], "name": "Backwoods Porter", "nameDisplay": "Backwoods Porter", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PdBP7Q/upload_UINqjc-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PdBP7Q/upload_UINqjc-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/PdBP7Q/upload_UINqjc-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
