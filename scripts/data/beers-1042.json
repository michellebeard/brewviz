Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "9", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "17", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "2.8", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:41", "fgMax": "1.012", "shortName": "Scottish Light", "abvMax": "3.5", "id": 7, "srmMin": "8", "name": "Scottish-Style Light Ale"}, "ibu": "18", "name": "Tally Wacker"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Beer is not available.", "id": 3, "name": "Not Available"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.mendobrew.com/", "established": "1983", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "We take great pride in being pioneers in the American Craft Brewing Renaissance and even greater pride in our range of ales that beer lovers all over the country have made Legends.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "8GdiRp", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ukiah", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "1252 Airport Park Blvd.", "postalCode": "95482", "website": "http://www.mendobrew.com/alehouse/mendocino-brewing-ale-house.html", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-707-467-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Mendocino Ale House", "latitude": 39.1289025, "locationType": "tasting", "region": "California", "longitude": -123.1993089, "updateDate": "2016-09-14 13:00:59", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "kaMWbG", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ukiah", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "1601 Airport Road", "postalCode": "95482", "website": "http://www.mendobrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1983", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-707-463-2627", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Mendocino Brewing Company", "latitude": 39.1326173, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -123.2005307, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "oIYpLB", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ukiah", "createDate": "2013-08-14 20:02:38", "streetAddress": "1601 Airport Road", "latitude": 39.1326173, "website": "http://www.mendobrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "yearOpened": "1983", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "95482", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Mendocino Brewing Company", "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -123.2005307, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Mendocino", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:52:01", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TR98tr/upload_13T8aG-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TR98tr/upload_13T8aG-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TR98tr/upload_13T8aG-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TR98tr/upload_13T8aG-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TR98tr/upload_13T8aG-icon.png"}, "id": "TR98tr", "name": "Mendocino Brewing Company"}], "name": "Talon - True Style Barley Wine Ale", "nameDisplay": "Talon - True Style Barley Wine Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/n9xIKr/upload_bZkk76-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/n9xIKr/upload_bZkk76-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/n9xIKr/upload_bZkk76-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.09", "description": "American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present.

Mexican Street Tacos, chile enfused candies, enchiladas one day, and Hamburgers, mac and cheese and ding dongs the next. As adults we realized how unique being raised on the border was, how the mix of flavors was seeping from north to south, and south to north. It was this fusion in flavors that inspired to take traditional, European brewing traditions and infuse the process with a whole new palette of Latin American ingredients.  So we dug into our own roots for inspiration and found a treasure trove of brewing traditions, ingredients and unique flavors.

This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "HeStKS", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Potosi", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "streetAddress": "209 South Main Street", "postalCode": "53820", "extendedAddress": "Box 177", "website": "http://www.potosibrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1852", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-763-4002", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.6716654, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -90.7271709, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Potosi", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-24 17:44:52", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png"}, "id": "Q4eTmd", "name": "Potosi Brewing Company"}], "description": "Enjoy a refreshing twist on our traditional IPA.

Our indoor space will have a large bar and tables for guests to sit back and enjoy a taster tray or a pint. We will also have a growler and 32oz bottle exchange to take beer home, with a small deposit encouraging the return and re-use of bottles/growlers.\r\n\r\nDecide to ride your bike to our brewery? Perfect! We have an indoor bike rack that holds 9 bicycles and will have a bike work station for you to do some tune-ups, pump up your tire, or easily fix that flat.

John Matthias Falliers founded Frankenmuth\u2019s first brewery in 1857. Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
