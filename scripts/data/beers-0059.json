You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2/3\u2019s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer.

And now, we're introducing art to our anniversary, creating a limited edition bottle design in collaboration with guru, Mike Watt.\"\r\n\r\nMike Watt is an Australian artist and illustrator based in Sydney. His mediums vary from biro, spray paint, brush and ink to digital. He describes his style as \"kind of gritty and ugly\", normally showing characters with lots of personality that have lived an interesting life.\r\n\"It's always great collaborating with Murray's.

While this year's special brew gives a nod to its roots, reflecting the original recipe brewed to launch the company on New Year's Eve nine years ago, the recipe twist is aging the beer on Hunter Valley red wine barrel staves.\r\n\r\n\"These staves will not only add flavour and aroma from the inside surfaces that have been in contact with the red wine, but will also add raw oakiness from the outside surfaces of the staves,\" said Head Brewer, Graeme Mahy. \"The end result of the staves provides a unique combination of part oaky, part red wine flavours.\"\r\n\r\nAn English-style barley wine, this year's Anniversary Ale features warming rich fruit cake-like sweetness from the caramel and roasted malts, with strong aromas of stone fruit and an assertive but balanced bitterness in the finish.\r\n\r\nThis big beer can be enjoyed now, however, we advise patience will be rewarded. Cellaring for 5-10 years (if you can) is recommended to maximise enjoyment from the maturing flavours.\r\n\r\n\"If you just can't hold out for 10 years, then try some over Christmas with a Christmas fruit pudding.

Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable.

The two made many friends spending spare evenings in New England pubs offering European beers, which, before the emergence of American craft beers, were the best beers available. The two often discussed their dream of opening their own brewery over the years. In August of 2012, John and Dan decided to take the keg into their own hands, and ENKI Brewing Company was born. Just a few months later, their dreams came to fruition at 7929 Victoria Drive.
