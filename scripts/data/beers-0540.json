The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "id": "71LkGn", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.threefloydspub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-219-922-3565", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.535541, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516686, "updateDate": "2015-06-18 14:42:36", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "GoDmMT", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:16", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.3floyds.com/", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "219-922-4425", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Munster", "latitude": 41.535536, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516687, "updateDate": "2015-04-01 18:55:51", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Three Floyds", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-07-29 12:02:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-icon.png"}, "id": "iodDki", "name": "Three Floyds Brewing Company"}], "description": "This Cascadian Immutable Dusk-style ale is as unwavering in its dark and beguiling flavor as is its namesake.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours.

Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry.
