We opened on March 25, 2011. The restaurant serves lunch and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "mailingListUrl": "http://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Durham", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "id": "vGotFH", "streetAddress": "107 East Parrish Street", "postalCode": "27701", "extendedAddress": "Suite 105", "website": "http://www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "919-680-2333", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.995445, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -78.899939, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Bull City Burger", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:12:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_OCIvTW-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png"}, "id": "eu1cAn", "name": "Bull City Burger and Brewery"}], "name": "Snow Hill", "nameDisplay": "Snow Hill", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BMeXAK/upload_Kwy2W4-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BMeXAK/upload_Kwy2W4-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BMeXAK/upload_Kwy2W4-icon.png"}, "createDate": "2012-09-14 18:21:49", "updateDate": "2012-09-14 18:21:50", "abv": "7.5", "id": "BMeXAK", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available at the same time of year, every year.", "id": 4, "name": "Seasonal"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.eastendbrewing.com/", "established": "2005", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "We are Production Brewery and Taproom in Pittsburgh's East End.

It\u2019s a place where we build our hopes and dreams, storing them on the wall neat as garden tools. Really, the garage is a hub. A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return.\r\n\r\nWe hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You\u2019ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d You can almost smell the oil and beer.\r\n\r\nBut more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It\u2019s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.\r\n\r\nFor Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan\u2019s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He\u2019s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary family.)\r\n\r\nSo welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You\u2019re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented. It\u2019s a great deal of work, but hell, that\u2019s what makes a dream worth pursuing.
