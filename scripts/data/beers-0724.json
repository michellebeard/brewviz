Some historians maintain that the whole business of founding a herring meal factory was just an excuse to get away from his mother\u2019s pots and pans. There is a legend saying that Didrik posted himself in the bow of the clipper carrying him away from his beloved hometown, and exclaimed \"No more rice and curry for this fair Dane!\" But the story has a happy end. Thanks to the fine lager brewed locally in Tranquebar, Didrik\u2019s indigestion was cured, and in fact he soon established his own brewery out there, creating a beer so tasty that rumors of it flew all the way back to Denmark. Perhaps the herring meal was the secret ingredient that distinguished Didrik\u2019s brew from all others. Anyhow, soon clippers carrying nothing but barrels of his product were leaving Tranquebar for Copenhagen every day of the week.
