In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.struisebrouwers.be/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Woesten", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "West-Vlaanderen", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "longitude": 2.7831, "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "Woesten", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2001", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "latitude": 50.900311, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qcAp7N", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "De Struise", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:44:16", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png"}, "id": "bjwFtZ", "name": "De Struise"}], "description": "Brewed by Jeroen on the occasion of their wedding.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness.
