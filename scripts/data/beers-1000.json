In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.struisebrouwers.be/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Woesten", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "West-Vlaanderen", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "longitude": 2.7831, "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "Woesten", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2001", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "latitude": 50.900311, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qcAp7N", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "De Struise", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:44:16", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png"}, "id": "bjwFtZ", "name": "De Struise"}], "name": "St. Amatus 12", "nameDisplay": "St. Amatus 12", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/YgFECA/upload_qsWTBe-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/YgFECA/upload_qsWTBe-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/YgFECA/upload_qsWTBe-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.084", "description": "Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.

In fact we\u2019ve had it figured out for years.  We both had our hearts set on brewing the sort of beer we loved so much in Yorkshire.\r\nMany people know that Martha and I love Theakston\u2019s Old Peculier, at least the cask version.  But Robinson\u2019s Old Tom is high on our list as well.  Now that Samuel Smith has released Yorkshire Stingo that makes three.  At the brewery where I worked in Yorkshire we made a unique beer called \u201cMorocco Ale\u201d  that is quite similar as well.\r\n\r\nObviously PRETTY THINGS isn\u2019t all about simple replication.  As a rule we don\u2019t do beer \u201cstyles\u201d straight up, as it doesn\u2019t leave any room for creativity.  Instead we take our inspiration from great beers as a starting point.\r\n\r\n\u201cRustic Dark Ale\u201d, is about as apt a descriptor as we could come up with for Saint Botolph\u2019s Town (we almost used \u201cNew World Stingo\u201d but decided to save that for a future beer).  This ale is formulated with the malts of Thomas Fawcett & Sons of Yorkshire, England as its base.  When I was brewing in Yorkshire I visited this magnificent maltings many times, seeing crystal and roasted malts still made by hand. On brew day their crystal malt gave an amazing golden raisin-like aroma in the kettle.  Fantastic!\r\n\r\nAs we did in Jack D\u2019Or, we used a small amount of Malted Oats, but cut it this time with Torrefied Wheat.  We \u201cchaptalized\u201d using four different types of sugar in very small doses for both flavour AND colour.\r\n\r\nSBT is fermented with two yeast strains for a unique rustic finish.  But it\u2019s in the yeast strains where this beer really departs from the typical: one is a German ale strain, the other is a common English strain.  Why?  Because it\u2019s about the flavour, not just ticking the \u201cstyle\u201d boxes.\r\n\r\nIn the end we have an ale of 5.9% abv with a big malty, almost smokey Black Malt character, a bitter attack from Fuggle hops, a rich barleymalt finish, some dried coconut hints and an old ale acidity around the edges.  We\u2019ve even timed its tan head, standing proud for ten minutes!\r\n\r\nThe name \u201cSaint Botolph\u2019s Town\u201d is in tribute to our great home in America: Boston.  The original Boston in Lincolnshire, England is an abbreviation of \u201cBotolph\u2019s Town\u201d or \u201cBotolph\u2019s Stone\u201d. When we were back in Yorkshire recently, we found a churchyard where St. Botolph spoke in the year 675; a \u2018stump\u2019 (broken old cross) marks the spot.  Saint Botolph is a 7th century saint from England whose feast day is June 17th.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 3, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:28:32", "shortName": "Sour", "id": 40, "name": "American-Style Sour Ale"}, "createDate": "2015-07-22 20:59:49", "updateDate": "2015-07-22 20:59:49", "styleId": 40, "id": "mfpkgR", "name": "St. Elmo Sour Ass"}]
