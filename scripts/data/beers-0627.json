First introduced in 1975, Liberty Ale\u00ae is brewed strictly according to traditional brewing methods, and uses only natural ingredients \u2014 pale malted barley, fresh whole-cone Cascade hops and a special top-fermenting yeast, and water.\r\n\r\nThe yeast used during fermentation produces many of Liberty Ale's subtle flavors and characteristics. A natural process called \"bunging\" creates gentle carbonation, and the practice of dry hopping (adding fresh hops to the brew during aging), revived by Anchor, creates its unique aroma.\r\n\r\nLiberty Ale\u00ae was first brewed to celebrate the bicentennial of Paul Revere\u2019s historic ride. As the first modern American IPA brewed after prohibition and the first modern American single-hop ale and dry-hopped ale, Anchor\u2019s Liberty Ale\u00ae is the original craft brewed ale and the beer that started a revolution.", "srmId": 8, "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "nameDisplay": "Liberty Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/5ZeTFl/upload_cghApN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/5ZeTFl/upload_cghApN-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/5ZeTFl/upload_cghApN-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.
