This beer style is so named because of the 18th century Russian Empress Catherine II\u2019s love for a similar dark, roasty, strong porter brewed in London and shipped to the Russian court.  Hallmarks of the style are rich maltiness from the massive grain bill, deep roast and chocolate character from highly kilned malts, all balanced by an elevated bitterness, hop flavor and alcohol content. Lacking the intensely bitter, burnt character of many stouts, we think it\u2019s roasty in all the right places, with a velvety mouthfeel and smooth finish.
