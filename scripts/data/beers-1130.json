Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "12", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:48", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "Scottish Heavy", "abvMax": "4", "id": 8, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Heavy Ale"}, "ibu": "25.8", "srm": {"hex": "A63E00", "id": 18, "name": "18"}, "name": "Wee Heavy"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Wee Heavy", "nameDisplay": "Wee Heavy", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.035", "description": "Scottish heavy ale is moderate in strength and dominated by a smooth, sweet maltiness balanced with low, but perceptible, hop bitterness. Hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Scottish heavy ale will have a medium degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels.
