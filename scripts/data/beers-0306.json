There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 3, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:28:32", "shortName": "Sour", "id": 40, "name": "American-Style Sour Ale"}, "id": "GSumk2", "createDate": "2016-07-05 13:02:28", "updateDate": "2016-07-05 13:04:17", "abv": "4.2", "styleId": 40, "ibu": "27", "name": "Derailed Series: Lucy"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:57", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Denver", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Colorado", "longitude": -104.9847179, "isClosed": "Y", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:57", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "latitude": 39.737567, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "cDW9jR", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Heavenly Daze Brewery and Grill", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:47:54", "id": "0rQw0S", "name": "Heavenly Daze Brewery and Grill"}], "name": "Derailer ESB", "nameDisplay": "Derailer ESB", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/l2kbOf/upload_vUp6RK-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/l2kbOf/upload_vUp6RK-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/l2kbOf/upload_vUp6RK-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.046", "description": "Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.
