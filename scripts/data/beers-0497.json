Just great hand-crafted beer brewed in West London with the best ingredients, knowledge, and respect for process, and a little insanity.\r\n\r\nBut why stop there? We don\u2019t believe in being stereotyped. We love upfront in-your-face hop focused beers, but are we only going to brew these? Hell no! We love beer, and we will brew whatever we want, whenever it suits us.\r\n\r\nAt Weird Beard we aim to continue making experimental, no-holds-barred beers that we feel excited about and we want to drink.\r\n\r\nInspired by the American and burgeoning British craft beer movement, along with great music, exquisite food, epic beards, and the outstanding beer community in our hometown of London, Weird Beard Brew Co will not compromise on anything to bring the best flavours to the beer, whether it is the roasted specialty grains in a stout or the newest hops in an IPA. We create beers that push the boundaries of style, forcing the consumer to stop and think about the drink in front of them, to confront the misconceptions of what ale and beer should or can be, and who drinks it? \r\n\r\nAnd before you ask, yes, Gregg and Bryan do sport some very impressive facial hair. Here at Weird Beard Brew Co we are all about the beards, but not so much the sandals. We are passionate about good beer, no matter where it comes from or how it is dispensed. You will find us in bottle shops, on cask in real ale pubs and in the best London beer bars on keg.\r\n\r\nWeird Beard Brew Co is a full on, no compromise brewery, brewing great tasting and genre-busting beers...hold on to your taste buds and come along for the ride!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-11-10 17:37:14", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "p0vg5z", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Hanwell", "createDate": "2014-11-10 17:59:01", "streetAddress": "Boston Business Park", "postalCode": "W72QA", "extendedAddress": "Unit 5", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "phone": "0203 645 2711", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 51.5000484, "locationType": "micro", "region": "London", "longitude": -0.338234, "updateDate": "2014-11-10 17:59:01", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Weird Beard Brew Co.", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:01:13", "id": "RWa0Ki", "name": "Weird Beard Brew Co."}], "name": "Hit the Lights", "ingredients": {"hops": [{"category": "hop", "createDate": "2013-06-24 16:07:27", "categoryDisplay": "Hops", "id": 9, "name": "Aurora"}, {"myrceneMax": 59, "category": "hop", "farneseneMax": 1, "description": "A strong bittering hop derived from Brewer's Gold, with contributions from Early Green, East Kent Golding, and others.

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "35", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "63", "abvMin": "5", "fgMin": "1.012", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:18:33", "fgMax": "1.018", "shortName": "English IPA", "abvMax": "7", "id": 2, "srmMin": "6", "name": "English-Style India Pale Ale"}, "ibu": "41", "name": "Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale"}]
