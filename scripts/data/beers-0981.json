As a chef does with spices, we look to get the best qualities of each hop and create a harmony of flavors and aromas. However, a few years ago, our brewmaster ran into a hop unique enough to deserve its own moment in the sun. A large Japanese brewery first developed the hop variety \u201cSorachi Ace\u201d in 1988. A cross between the British \u201cBrewer\u2019s Gold\u201d and the Czech \u201cSaaz\u201d varieties, it exhibited a quality that was unexpected \u2013 it smelled really lemony.\r\nThe unique flavor of Sorachi Ace was bypassed by the big brewers, but we thought it was pretty cool. So we made a special beer with it, and added the beer to our Brewmaster\u2019s Reserve special draft beer program last year. Most Brewmaster\u2019s Reserve beers are only available for a short time, and then they\u2019re gone. But we liked this one so much, we decided to bring it back and give it the star treatment. Brooklyn Sorachi Ace is a classic saison, a cracklingly dry, hoppy unfiltered golden farmhouse ale, but made entirely with now-rare Sorachi Ace hops grown by a single farm in Washington. We ferment it with our special Belgian ale strain, and then add more Sorachi Ace hops post-fermentation. After the dry-hopping, the beer emerges with a bright spicy lemongrass / lemon zest aroma backed by a wonderfully clean malt flavor.\r\nIt tastes like sunshine in a glass, and that suits us just fine, especially with seafood dishes and fresh cheeses.
