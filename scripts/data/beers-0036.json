Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana.

For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston.

It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for.

Since that time, A.B., his son (Warner Marion), grandson (William Craig), great grandson (Edward Kent), and/or great-great grandson ( Michael) have continuously practiced law in the State of Texas. \r\n\r\n Named after Alfred Brown Peticolas, our English brown ale is a dialed back version of the American interpretation. It\u2019s copper in color with a pleasantly light hop aroma, which is balanced with a delicate roasty maltiness. Notes of nut and chocolate are subdued, but clearly present in flavor. This beer\u2019s body is medium-light and possesses a smooth texture with a hint of residual sweetness. \r\n\r\n The roasted characteristics of this beer make it the perfect match for any meats or vegetables prepared on the grill.\r\n\r\n A little more on A.B. Peticolas? He was born in Richmond, Virginia, on May 27, 1838. As a young man, he studied law and taught school. He began his practice in Virginia, but ultimately moved west to Victoria, Texas. In 1859, he opened up a law practice with Samuel A. White. A.B. Peticolas may be best remembered today for his published Civil War journals and detailed pencil sketches, having served during the Sibley Campaign in New Mexico with Co. C., 4th Regiment, Texas Mounted Volunteers. After his discharge in 1865, he returned to Victoria to practice law. In 1894, A.B. Peticolas authored an index-digest to all civil cases contained in the Texas Report. This catalog became standard text of the Texas Bar Association for years. In his later years, A.B.
