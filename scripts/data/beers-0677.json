Both had been home brewing for years, and started brewing together in their back yards in the summer of 2010. The goal of the first brews was to make enough beer for Nate\u2019s upcoming wedding. In the ensuing months the two continued brewing on a regular basis, creating better beers, refining the equipment and process and devising some great new recipes. As they continued to brew together, talk turned to the idea of an eventual commercial venture.\r\n\r\nTJ, a mutual friend of the two brewers noted that he could provide some equipment to allow for some larger brewing projects. Having this greater capacity led to the realization, that as much fun as it might be to try, the three of them would not be able to drink nearly as much as they were certain to produce and the beer would have to be shared with the public. The wheels were officially set in motion to make the jump from hobbyists to professional brewers.\r\n\r\nTo round out the team, the trio turned to some other friends. Drew had joined in on the occasional brewing session, and one of his creations took home a prize at a local brewing competition. Ron brought to the table the business and accounting skills needed to make this a business. Five friends who enjoyed hanging out together had just hit on the magic formula to turn fun into a business.\r\n\r\nBucket opened its pilot brewery in the Lorraine Mills in Pawtucket. The space was a 375 square foot room, and the equipment was largely retooled and designed to create a 1 BBL brewery. The first keg of beer went on tap in November 2012 and within a couple of months it was clear that the demand was huge and a bigger brewery would be needed.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2013, the pilot brewery closed and construction began on a full scale production brewery in August. Located in the mill at 545 Pawtucket Avenue, the new space was nearly 10 times larger at 3400 square feet. With a 10 BBL brewhouse, the production capacity grew ten-fold as well.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 2013, brewing began in the new facility and in November, Bucket Brewery was officially opened to the public. In addition to the kegs of beer that were the exclusive packaging in the pilot site, Bucket started shipping beer in 64oz and 32oz containers. The beer has beer very well received by our Rhode Island customers and the brewery continues to grow!\r\n\r\nBucket now holds tours and tastings every Saturday, as well as the Friday Night Sound Check music and art series, and other events.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-02-21 13:02:25", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Friday 1:00-7:30 \r\nSaturday 11:00-5:00", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Pawtucket", "createDate": "2015-02-21 13:02:26", "id": "PwIQok", "streetAddress": "545 Pawtucket Ave", "latitude": 41.859093, "website": "http://bucketbrewery.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "02860", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Rhode Island", "longitude": -71.398175, "updateDate": "2016-09-20 15:52:12", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Bucket", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:05:11", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ZB3WRj/upload_a6AxDn-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ZB3WRj/upload_a6AxDn-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ZB3WRj/upload_a6AxDn-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ZB3WRj/upload_a6AxDn-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ZB3WRj/upload_a6AxDn-icon.png"}, "id": "ZB3WRj", "name": "Bucket Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.055", "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.

"name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "This beer style is unusual in that its impetus is to commemorate combinations of ingredients and/or techniques adopted by or unique to a particular region. At least one regional combination of ingredients and/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:45:15", "shortName": "Indigenous Beer", "id": 128, "name": "Indigenous Beer (Lager or Ale)"}, "createDate": "2015-07-28 20:47:21", "updateDate": "2015-07-28 20:47:21", "abv": "5.8", "styleId": 128, "id": "bvK8AJ", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Meta Modern", "srmId": 9, "nameDisplay": "Meta Modern", "breweries": [{"website": "http://otxbc.com", "established": "2014", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Producing iconic, rustic beers in the heart of the Texas Hill Country", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-05-22 14:18:45", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Thu: 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Austin", "createDate": "2014-05-22 14:20:04", "id": "s6xmV6", "streetAddress": "6550 Comanche Trail", "latitude": 30.4058986, "extendedAddress": "Suite 301", "website": "http://otxbc.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2014", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "78732", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Oasis Texas Brewing Company", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Texas", "longitude": -97.8739516, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Oasis Texas", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:54:19", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1Lis85/upload_romrvI-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1Lis85/upload_romrvI-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1Lis85/upload_romrvI-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1Lis85/upload_romrvI-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1Lis85/upload_romrvI-icon.png"}, "id": "1Lis85", "name": "Oasis Texas Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "description": "Session India Pale Ales are gold to copper.

Astringency of highly roasted malt should be absent. Toast and caramel-like malt characters may be evident. Low to medium hop bitterness are perceived. Low hop flavor and aroma are perceived. It is originally a style from Dortmund. Adambier is a strong, dark, hoppy, sour ale extensively aged in wood barrels. Extensive aging and the acidification of this beer can mask malt and hop character to varying degrees. Traditional and non-hybrid varieties of European hops were traditionally used. A K\u00f6lsch-like ale fermentation is typical Aging in barrels may contribute some level of Brettanomyces and lactic character.
