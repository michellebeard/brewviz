Time to bring it back to its Alaskan roots and reengage the vast majority of the community that had walked away from it.\r\n\r\nBob & Mark brought up the idea for an event so out there, so uniquely Alaskan that it was destined for success. All it needed was someone (enter Susan Duck, Rondy's Executive Director) to round up some reindeer, a little planning and insurance... insurance that took nine months to find. Finally, the last company on the list, agreed to insure the event.\r\nAt that moment, the legendary Rondy Running of the Reindeer was born. Born of a trinity of minds just twisted enough to see the potential joy it could bring to all on hand. Bob & Mark added in the United States Marine Corps Toys for Tots as their benficiary and to date we have raised over $30,000 for them.\r\n\r\nSusan added in the costume element when she relayed to the registrants a challenge from one \"Margy J.\", who \"challenged everyone to show the world how Alaskans Run with the Reindeer - boas, sequins, etc.\".
