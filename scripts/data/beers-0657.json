Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "12", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:48", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "Scottish Heavy", "abvMax": "4", "id": 8, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Heavy Ale"}, "id": "LsaAbx", "createDate": "2015-02-10 20:03:43", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 21:25:08", "abv": "8.5", "styleId": 8, "ibu": "25", "name": "Major Oak Wee Heavy Ale"}, {"status": "verified", "srm": {"hex": "FBB123", "id": 5, "name": "5"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "As the days get longer and planes fly higher, Major Tom\u2019s is as refreshing as a summer vacation.
