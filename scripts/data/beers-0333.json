The three of us may be related by blood, but our staff, our customers, and our collaborators have all become brothers.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about the people we\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with and making sure we had the ability to continue to grow, we made the bold decision to rebrand our business as Brothers Craft Brewing.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges associated with such a change, we feel that our new name truly represents our evolution as a business. Why limit our brotherhood to three when we\u2019ve gained so much family already?\r\n\r\nWhen we started this endeavor, we couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined the growth we\u2019ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we\u2019ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we\u2019ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all for everything you\u2019ve done for us. Thank you for keeping our dream alive.\r\n\r\nCheers!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-02-23 14:39:19", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "8n537L", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Harrisonburg", "createDate": "2013-02-23 14:40:25", "streetAddress": "800 North Main St.", "postalCode": "22802", "website": "https://brotherscraftbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(540) 435-6008", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.4576002, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Virginia", "longitude": -78.8612002, "updateDate": "2016-09-14 13:02:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brothers Craft", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-02-19 20:57:46", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-icon.png"}, "id": "R4fiI1", "name": "Brothers Craft Brewing"}], "description": "Escape the mundane with this Citra-based, Session IPA, the perfect beer to end a workday or to carry you through a weekend with friends.

From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc\u2026) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.\r\n\r\nSalish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner. \r\n\r\nJeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.  They are family oriented and hope for the brewery to be family approachable.   Families are welcome, but this is a brewery with a tasting room, not a playground (we do not cater to children).

Our publicly-held brewery employs over 150 people who are as passionate about quality craft beer as Kurt & Rob themselves.\r\n\r\nWe opened the brewery in 1984, and built a new 40-barrel brewing system in our current Russell Street location in 1990. We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:13", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "SgctbA", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Portland", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:13", "streetAddress": "929 North Russell Street", "postalCode": "97227", "website": "http://www.widmer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "503-281-2437", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 45.540795, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -122.675594, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Widmer Brothers", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:02:38", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8wcv7h/upload_61693P-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8wcv7h/upload_61693P-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8wcv7h/upload_61693P-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8wcv7h/upload_61693P-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8wcv7h/upload_61693P-icon.png"}, "id": "8wcv7h", "name": "Widmer Brothers Brewing"}], "ibu": "18", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 03:16:21", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:07"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.twinpeaksrestaurant.com/", "established": "2013", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Located inside the Twin Peaks restaurant at the N.
