The 2014 vintage of Devil\u2019s Milk epitomizes the American Barleywine. A medium bodied, amber ale with a thin, persistent, off-white head and a complex flavor profile with an assertive hop bill. Mesmerizing citrus flavors and aromas of the palate dominating hop finish and warming alcohol presence. Devil\u2019s Milk is best served in a snifter, both to accommodate its alcohol content and allow the complex flavors inherent in the beer to emerge as it warms in the glass.\r\n\r\nThe Brewer\u2019s Association of Maryland Governor\u2019s Cup 2006, 2007 and 2008 - Gold Medal", "srmId": 25, "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 6, "name": "Snifter"}, "nameDisplay": "Devil's Milk", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/mx1dMv/upload_8G2wRA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/mx1dMv/upload_8G2wRA-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/mx1dMv/upload_8G2wRA-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.106", "id": "mx1dMv", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-01-19 23:31:38", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 21:27:28", "abv": "10.6", "styleId": 34, "glasswareId": 6, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.09", "description": "American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.
