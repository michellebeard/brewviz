Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

Regardless, the style follows this progression: a Trippel is bigger and stronger than a Dubbel, therefore a Quad should be bigger and stronger than a Trippel. Additionally, the flavor profile is different style by style.A Belgian \u201csingle\u201d can pretty much be anything, but often are light or pale in color (re: Belgian Pale Ale). A Dubbel is usually made with some roasted malts and dark cara-malts making it darker in color. A Trippel is usually very light in color (like the narrowly exampled \u201csingle\u201d) and high in alcohol. So lets consider a Quad to be a Double Dubbel \u2013 ours with the added twist of a generous addition of (real) red tart cherries. The color is amber with some red hues and it also holds a nice rich head. The aroma will be distinctively Belgian in character.
