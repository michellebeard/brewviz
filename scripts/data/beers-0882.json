We really enjoyed the subtle flavors of gooseberries and sauvignon blanc grapes that characterize this hop, but because the flavors are delicate and require large amounts of hops, we thought the lighter malt bill of a session ale provided the best base on which to build this beer. Maintaining body in such a low ABV beer was very important to us, so we added a large amount of low crystals and flaked oats to our base of Pilsner malt. Nelson is a unique hop, but to avoid a finished product that was one dimensional, we rounded out the hop flavor with a small amount of Simcoe for bittering and added Amarillo and Citra to the finish and dry hop.
