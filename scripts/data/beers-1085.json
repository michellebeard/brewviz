Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes.

At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-08-03 00:34:11", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.innisandgunn.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 55.951976, "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Edinburgh", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "longitude": -3.211095, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+44 (0) 131 337 4420", "streetAddress": "6 Randolph Crescent", "createDate": "2012-08-03 12:39:07", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}, "postalCode": "EH3 7TH", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "0HAazs", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Innis & Gunn", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:30:32", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_HlQFKB-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_HlQFKB-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_HlQFKB-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_HlQFKB-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_HlQFKB-icon.png"}, "id": "jC0TAa", "name": "Innis & Gunn"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
