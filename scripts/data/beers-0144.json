Cheers!\r\n\r\nThe style \u201cIndia Black Ale\u201d is so new, that there\u2019s no one, all authoritative beer that we need to compare to. The trick is to get the balance between the malt bitterness and the hop bitterness. In this case we used non-astringent roasted malts to add the roasted flavors. The malt is a de-husked German black malt, it provides the color, and the roast flavor without the risk of extra acidity. It creates this intense roasted coffee and chocolate aroma. When we add the hops you\u2019ll get that pine and citrus smell. When we released the test batch last year it went over really well.
