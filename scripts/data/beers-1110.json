Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E.

This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hefeweizen, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a four-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The room was once the storage area for The Boy Scouts of America Aurora chapter\u2019s canoes and the area gained the nickname \u201cCanoe Room,\u201d which stuck.\r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale).

In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Wed:5:00 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 3:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Fort Worth", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "id": "X6U0o8", "streetAddress": "701 Galveston Avenue", "postalCode": "76104", "website": "http://www.rahrbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2004", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "817-810-9266", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 32.7368128, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Texas", "longitude": -97.3275585, "updateDate": "2014-10-29 16:04:43", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Rahr & Sons", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-11-07 13:13:03", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_ixkkW0-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_ixkkW0-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_ixkkW0-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_ixkkW0-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WCBdy2/upload_ixkkW0-icon.png"}, "id": "WCBdy2", "name": "Rahr & Sons Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.034", "description": "Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style guidelines.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "id": "71LkGn", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.threefloydspub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-219-922-3565", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.535541, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516686, "updateDate": "2015-06-18 14:42:36", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "GoDmMT", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Munster", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:16", "streetAddress": "9750 Indiana Parkway", "postalCode": "46321", "website": "http://www.3floyds.com/", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "219-922-4425", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Munster", "latitude": 41.535536, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Indiana", "longitude": -87.516687, "updateDate": "2015-04-01 18:55:51", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Three Floyds", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-07-29 12:02:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_Va4zor-icon.png"}, "id": "iodDki", "name": "Three Floyds Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 4, "name": "German Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.047", "description": "The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.
