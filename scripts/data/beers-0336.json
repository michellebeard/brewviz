After a chance meeting in the Anchor Brewing Tasting Room, Kevin and Marisa decided to follow their crazy dreams and move to Colorado, Kevin's home state, and brew.  With a combined passion for craft beer, Kevin and Marisa founded the Vail Valley\u2019s first production brewery.  Crazy Mountain was built with love from the ground up in a gutted warehouse, shipping in tanks and equipment from around the globe. Their first beer was poured at a beer festival in Vail in January 2010.  Using the highest quality ingredients, Crazy Mountain handcrafts each brew for beer enthusiasts across the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, and Sweden.

Its Anchor Steam\u00ae Beer is San Francisco\u2019s original since 1896. \r\n\r\nIn 1965, Fritz Maytag acquired and revived the struggling brewery at a time when mass production of beer dominated and seemed unstoppable. Maytag started a revolution in beer that originated today\u2019s craft beer movement. \r\nAn undisputed icon, Anchor is America\u2019s first craft brewery where beers are handmade in our traditional copper brewhouse from an all-malt mash. At Anchor, we practice the time-honored art of classical brewing, employing state-of-the-art methods to ensure that our beers are always pure and fresh. We know of no brewery in the world that matches our efforts to combine traditional, natural brewing with such carefully applied, modern methods of sanitation, finishing, packaging and transporting.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "mailingListUrl": "http://www.anchorbrewing.com/connect/contact", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Two tours are available each weekday by reservation only.

While he was working out east, he enjoyed the superb beer culture and variety of beers available in New England. But he knew that he would one day return to Missouri. Finally, after three years, probably too many beers, and the addition of his son, Nick finally got his chance to come back to Missouri. He worked at a small brewpub in Kansas City called The 75th Street Brewery where he was able to experiment with many different beer styles and brewing techniques. Again after a few years, Nick grew restless. While working at a brewpub was fun and enjoyable, it just had too many other distractions from his true passions... Brewing beer, drinking beer and spreading the word about craft beer.\r\nSo he started the Doodle Brewing Company with every intention of brewing beers and beer styles that explore the boundries of flavor.
