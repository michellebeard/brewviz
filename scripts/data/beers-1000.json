This Bavarian Hefeweizen (\"hefe\" means yeast and \"weizen\" refers to wheat), combines pure wheat flavor with Bayern's own strain of yeast. Bayern's Hefeweizen is hopped moderately with Hallertauer Perle from Germany, has an alcohol content of 5.4% Alcohol by Volume (13.1% Plato o.g.) and is made using malted wheat, pale and caramel malt. The hefeweizen beer style was invented in Bavaria and Bayern Brewing's version is one of the very few that is actually brewed as it is in Bavaria by a Bavarian Brewmaster. So if you are interested in this style of beer, try this one first and see how the other ones compare to the original. \r\n\r\n St. Wilbur Weizen is brewed using the recipe of the old Brauerei zum Schiff brewery in Kaufbeuren, Germany, which is located 60 miles southwest of Munich and was established in 1540. J\u00fcrgen Kn\u00f6ller, the owner of Bayern Brewing, apprenticed in this brewery from 1978 to 1981 and brought this original recipe to Missoula in 1987. \r\n\r\n In 2002, J\u00fcrgen decided to rename Bayern's Hefeweizen \"St Wilbur Weizen\" after his beloved St. Bernard, Wilbur, who had been adopted from the Humane Society. Sympathetic with the issues of these large breed dogs, Bayern now donates a portion of sales of this beer style and all affiliated merchandise to the Saint Bernard Rescue Foundation.
