It was a Westvleteren 12, a beer brewed by Belgian Monks. I had no idea that beer could have such complex flavors. The experience instantly changed my life and set me off on an adventure around the world in pursuit of deeper insight into global brewing cultures and techniques.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 and 2011, I worked with breweries in England, Japan and Denmark, picked hops in West Kent, and befriended brewers from around the globe. The experiences and trade secrets I picked up inspired me to start a brewery where I could bring new and innovative beers back home to the U.S. Together with my partners Brian Berge, Kevin Hilliard, and Eric Schmidt, we\u2019ve made that dream come true with Insight Brewing Company.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-01-19 21:35:12", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Minneapolis", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Minnesota", "longitude": -93.21295, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "(612) 722-7222", "streetAddress": "2821 East Hennepin Avenue", "createDate": "2015-01-19 21:36:04", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-28 13:36:58", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "55413", "latitude": 44.991933, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "elfZCu", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Insight", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:04:03", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/h5zbGr/upload_43XhSq-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/h5zbGr/upload_43XhSq-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/h5zbGr/upload_43XhSq-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/h5zbGr/upload_43XhSq-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/h5zbGr/upload_43XhSq-icon.png"}, "id": "h5zbGr", "name": "Insight Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a balance between the style's character and the smoky properties.

Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.
