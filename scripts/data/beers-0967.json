Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "9", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "17", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "2.8", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:41", "fgMax": "1.012", "shortName": "Scottish Light", "abvMax": "3.5", "id": 7, "srmMin": "8", "name": "Scottish-Style Light Ale"}, "createDate": "2013-11-04 23:48:20", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 06:50:20", "styleId": 7, "id": "nc4YDz", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available at the same time of year, every year.", "id": 4, "name": "Seasonal"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.frontstreetbrewery.com/", "established": "1995", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Located in Historic Downtown, the Front Street Brewery is Wilmington\u2019s only Restaurant with its own Brewery.
