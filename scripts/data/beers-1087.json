From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DrFlD0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Carlsbad", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "571 Carlsbad Village Dr.", "postalCode": "92008", "website": "http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/carlsbad/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "760-720-7007", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Carlsbad", "latitude": 33.1596505, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.3478111, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun - Thur - 11am - 10pm\r\nFri - Sat. - 11am - Midnight", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Solana Beach", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "qAyZMR", "streetAddress": "135 N.

Little bitterness is perceived, and hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Despite its lightness, Scottish light ale will have a degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character.

The color will range from golden amber to deep brown Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "9", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "17", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "2.8", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:41", "fgMax": "1.012", "shortName": "Scottish Light", "abvMax": "3.5", "id": 7, "srmMin": "8", "name": "Scottish-Style Light Ale"}, "id": "GlZJNG", "createDate": "2013-09-29 18:47:56", "updateDate": "2015-06-17 19:46:15", "abv": "4", "styleId": 7, "ibu": "14", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.fullpintbrewing.com/", "established": "2009", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Full Pint Brewing Company is a collaborative brewery featuring some of the Pittsburgh area\u2019s finest brewers and beer nerds.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:55", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "W0G7sk", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "North Versailles", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:55", "streetAddress": "1963 Lincoln Hwy", "postalCode": "15137", "website": "http://www.fullpintbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "724-396-9796", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 40.3648191, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -79.7748442, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Full Pint", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:19:21", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Sx5SJH/upload_gf8hkE-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Sx5SJH/upload_gf8hkE-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Sx5SJH/upload_gf8hkE-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Sx5SJH/upload_gf8hkE-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Sx5SJH/upload_gf8hkE-icon.png"}, "id": "Sx5SJH", "name": "Full Pint Brewing Company"}], "description": "This Imperial IPA was triple-batched, using a different hop and crystal malt in each batch.

Coming soon will be bottled beer!\r\n\r\nIn the taproom, the selection recently increased to 25 taps directly behind the J shaped bar. The upper loft has darts, shuffle board and three big screen TVs. Behind the building you will find a Beer Garden including horseshoe pits and ample seating.\r\n\r\nMenu beers available year round are Promiscuous Pilsner, Tommy Gun Red, Gangster IPA, and Smuggler\u2019s Hazelnut Stout.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.
