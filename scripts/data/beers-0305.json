This lager is fermented at 55 degrees for one week and lagered (German for stored) for at least two more weeks. The sharp hop bite up front is intended to keep the palette clean; giving the beer high drink ability.  There is no after taste, the finish turns right off.  This is the perfect session beer.  Pairs great with spicy foods.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "DESERT PILSNER", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jLUU76/upload_1yTf0y-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jLUU76/upload_1yTf0y-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jLUU76/upload_1yTf0y-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.048", "id": "jLUU76", "createDate": "2015-06-12 17:26:36", "updateDate": "2015-06-12 17:26:37", "abv": "5.4", "styleId": 75, "availableId": 1, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 7, "name": "European-germanic Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped. Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 7, "srmMax": "4", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "4", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:35:59", "fgMax": "1.012", "shortName": "German Pilsener", "abvMax": "5", "id": 75, "srmMin": "3", "name": "German-Style Pilsener"}, "ibu": "37", "name": "DESERT PILSNER"}]
