The authors of the style tried to brew a beer which was very similar to IPA in terms of aroma and taste but had a deep black color.

Armed with a we can do this attitude the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to found the Wachusett Brewing Co. in 1993. Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry. Wachusett Ales continue to be hand crafted with the finest ingredients available, bottled and kegged in our Westminster facility.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels.

Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas are prominent. Some slight roasted malt acidity is permissible and a medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel is appropriate. Hop bitterness may be moderate to high. Hop aroma and flavor is moderate to high, often with American citrus-type and/or resiny hop character. The perception of fruity esters is low. Roasted malt/barley astringency may be low but not excessive. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be negligible or not perceived. Head retention is excellent.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "35", "categoryId": 3, "srmMax": "40", "ibuMax": "60", "abvMin": "5.7", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:28:43", "fgMax": "1.022", "shortName": "American Stout", "abvMax": "8.8", "id": 42, "srmMin": "40", "name": "American-Style Stout"}, "createDate": "2015-12-01 18:12:28", "updateDate": "2015-12-18 05:55:11", "abv": "6", "styleId": 42, "availableId": 1, "id": "cPc4Hw", "name": "Black Tail Stout"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Black Talon", "nameDisplay": "Black Talon", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.pawpawbrewing.com/", "established": "2010", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Paw Paw Brewing Company set out to bring the best brew to the area possible using the best ingredients.
