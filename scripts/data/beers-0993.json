Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association\u2019s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com.
