Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:30:28", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Traverse City", "createDate": "2013-11-18 12:32:00", "id": "1QFuku", "streetAddress": "2959 Hartman Rd", "postalCode": "49685", "website": "http://www.breweryterrafirma.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(231) 929-1600", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.7154521, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -85.6354376, "updateDate": "2014-09-29 20:36:47", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brewery Terra Firma", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-10-19 18:22:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dvuEzd/upload_YIRhuN-icon.png"}, "id": "dvuEzd", "name": "Brewery Terra Firma"}], "description": "This assertive American style double brown ale is deep mahogany in color and is a firm, clean, complex representation of the style with malt, caramel and nutty notes.

Over time, as Bob became more interested in cider, we started traveling to the Pays D\u2019Auge region of Normandy, where we tasted many varieties of this traditional beverage that is typically served with meals, and is the perfect complement to the wonderful cuisine of the area.\r\nAs we experienced the cider culture of northern France, we realized that nothing like these dry, complex ciders existed in the U.S., and we became excited about the prospect of introducing a French-style cider to the American palate. Back at our orchard, we began planting cider cultivars from France, England and America, while testing the types that would work best with the Island\u2019s climate and rocky limestone soil.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm).

We are proud to share the next leg of our journey with you. The Fresh Oak Brett Project was begun to explore not only the flavors of fresh oak barrels, but to also experiment with available strains of wild yeasts, or brettanomyces, to see what flavors the develop during fermentation.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:56", "shortName": "BBL Aged Sour", "id": 136, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer"}, "createDate": "2015-05-22 15:06:28", "updateDate": "2015-12-18 01:56:03", "styleId": 136, "availableId": 2, "id": "uQzhyA", "name": "Bruxellensis - The Fresh Oak Brett Project"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.alphabrewingcompany.com/", "established": "2013", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Aggressive Ales. \r\nAlpha Brewing Company is a St. Louis Microbrewery.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-11-21 16:48:28", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "LeJZox", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "St. Louis", "createDate": "2013-11-21 16:49:51", "streetAddress": "1409 Washington Ave", "postalCode": "63101", "website": "http://www.alphabrewingcompany.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "314-621-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.6327356, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Missouri", "longitude": -90.1998977, "updateDate": "2015-12-03 19:17:27", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Alpha", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:48:30", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jWWHko/upload_ZojEuS-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jWWHko/upload_ZojEuS-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jWWHko/upload_ZojEuS-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jWWHko/upload_ZojEuS-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jWWHko/upload_ZojEuS-icon.png"}, "id": "jWWHko", "name": "Alpha Brewing Co"}], "name": "Br\u00fc\u0259r", "nameDisplay": "Br\u00fc\u0259r", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LOXlhz/upload_VjS2pX-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LOXlhz/upload_VjS2pX-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LOXlhz/upload_VjS2pX-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.09", "description": "American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.
