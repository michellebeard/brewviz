My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

Final Absolution (Belgian Style Trippel) is our flagship and our most award winning beer. Our brew house is a three barrel system from Heavy Duty Products in Ontario, Canada. Last year we produced 2,400 barrels of beer. We also serve a small selection of meads and wines in our pub.  In November of 2013 we installed a brand new 20 barrel brew house fabricated by Craftwerk located in Michigan.  This new system will help us meet the growing demand in our state.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:53", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "OyQarF", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Warren", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:53", "streetAddress": "14600 East Eleven Mile Road", "postalCode": "48089", "website": "http://dragonmead.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "586-776-9428", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.493159, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -82.9741767, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Dragonmead Microbrewery", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:44:47", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9HcWSd/upload_AqPobI-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9HcWSd/upload_AqPobI-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9HcWSd/upload_AqPobI-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9HcWSd/upload_AqPobI-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9HcWSd/upload_AqPobI-icon.png"}, "id": "9HcWSd", "name": "Dragonmead Microbrewery"}], "originalGravity": "1.079", "id": "9XbIQ2", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:11", "updateDate": "2014-09-12 15:39:00", "abv": "11", "styleId": 34, "availableId": 7, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.09", "description": "American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.
