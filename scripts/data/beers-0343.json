The unique brewing process, which takes about 90 days, guarantees a pure character, delicate effervescence and a pleasant sweet taste of alcohol.\r\n\r\nApart from pure spring water, which is the main ingredient of beer, barley is the most important raw material. Barley must germinate for five days in the malt house, after which malt remains. The colour of the malt and as a consequence also of the beer is determined by the temperature. Duvel obtains its typical bitterness by adding various varieties of aromatic Slovenian and Czech hops. We use only exclusive hops that are renowned for their constant, outstanding quality.\r\n\r\nDuvel ferments for the first time in tanks at 20 to 26\u00b0C. The brewer uses his own culture for this. The original yeast strain, which Victor Moortgat himself selected in the 1920\u2019s, originates from Scotland. After maturing in storage tanks in which the beer is cooled down to -2\u00b0C, the drink is ready for bottling. Thanks to the addition of extra sugars and yeast, the beer ferments again in the bottle. This occurs in warm cellars (24\u00b0C) and takes two weeks. Then the beer is moved to cold cellars, where it continues to mature and stabilise for a further six weeks. This extra long maturation period is unique and contributes to the refined flavour and pure taste of Duvel.\r\n\r\nA team of beer specialists checks the process daily by means of taste analyses. It is only after 90 days, when it has achieved its rich range of flavours, that Duvel may leave the brewery.\r\n\r\nThanks to its surprisingly high alcohol content (8.5 %), enormous head, fine effervescence and silky smooth feel in the mouth, Duvel stands out clearly from other Belgian beers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Duvel", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/c8VKLu/upload_mPvjPh-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/c8VKLu/upload_mPvjPh-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/c8VKLu/upload_mPvjPh-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.07", "description": "Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

Brewed and bottled in small batches with only honest ingredients, BarrelHouse beers are extremely fresh and exceptionally flavorful. Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today.
