Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.

With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "lAcrbq", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Gadsden", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "streetAddress": "200 North 6th St.", "postalCode": "35901", "website": "http://www.backfortybeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "256-467-4912", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 34.015484, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alabama", "longitude": -86.005585, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Back Forty", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:06:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-icon.png"}, "id": "KkUzjZ", "name": "Back Forty Beer Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "Coffee beers use coffee in any of its forms other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character.

But don\u2019t let our country dwelling, nature-loving heritage fool you: we occasionally like to take a walk on the wild side.  My dad, Bob, has been creatively living for years, pushing the envelope, pursuing each unique business venture with grace, fortitude, and certainly persistence.  Cultivating the beautiful Michigan land, farming sweet raspberries & outstanding apples, starting and operating a tart cherry juice concentrate business were all on the list of the accomplishments, passions, and past times for my dad and mom, Marie.  Marie's essence has always been built purely on thinking outside the box.  She is an artist, entrepreneur, a super fit grandmother, and is the glue holding our family together.   \r\n\r\nWhen I returned from a sabbatical to Southeast Asia in 2014 after a career as an engineer, I returned with an idea, \u201cDad, let\u2019s make hard cider\u201d.  Yes, he thought I was crazy.  Maybe I am.  But why not?  I had a vision.  It all made sense.  Our family had all of the pieces of a puzzle that just needed to be put together.  Dad had grown and managed apple orchards for over 30 years plus he always dares to be different.  He taught us kids to do the same.  Mom & Dad had built successful tart cherry juice business they ran for years.  My brother Rob has a long standing successful career in sales and my sister-in-law Melissa creatively juggled cooking, crafts, and being a mother of three.  All of us were foodies and all of us were passionate about cider. \r\n\r\nWe are farmers, engineers, artists, and entrepreneurs.  Cider was it. \r\n\r\nAnd so, Painted Turtle Hard Cider was born. \r\n\r\nThe vision of Painted Turtle is this:  Be creative.  Move forward.  Take chances.  Live with no regret.  Dare to Drink Different. \r\n\r\nThe Painted Turtle is the Michigan state reptile, so it was fitting that this could represent our local handcrafted product.  But also, Michigan Painted Turtles are\u2026.fearless;  Kind of like our family.  We move forward no matter what life deals us.   This is how we want to live and how we want everyone to live. \r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy our Hard Cider.  It was hand crafted in small batches exclusively by our family using only quality Michigan apples and ingredients.  It was made simply in a classic English style using only the best local ingredients selected by us.  It's fermented slowly for great flavor.  However, be aware: it\u2019s different, it\u2019s unique, but trust me, you deserve to live on the edge.  It very well may be something a little different than what\u2019s out there and what you are used to; I admit that we just decided to design it that way. \r\n\r\nWe know this will be the best hard cider you\u2019ve ever had and we\u2019re not afraid to say it.  From our family to yours, go out on a limb, live creativity, be enchanted.\r\n\r\nDrink Painted Turtle and Dare to Drink Different. \r\n \r\nTracy Loughlin \r\nCider Maker, Painted Turtle Hard Cider", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-10-03 13:51:03", "mailingListUrl": "info@paintedturtlehardcider.com", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Cidery", "locality": "Lowell", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Michigan", "longitude": -85.3419609, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "createDate": "2016-10-03 13:53:10", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2016", "updateDate": "2016-10-03 13:53:10", "latitude": 42.9336426, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "APGTxX", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Painted Turtle Hard Cider", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-10-03 13:52:22", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/MiO4CS/upload_ckDMnS-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/MiO4CS/upload_ckDMnS-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/MiO4CS/upload_ckDMnS-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/MiO4CS/upload_ckDMnS-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/MiO4CS/upload_ckDMnS-icon.png"}, "id": "MiO4CS", "name": "Painted Turtle Hard Cider"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 12, "name": "Mead, Cider, & Perry"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Variable, but should be a medium, refreshing drink.

At least one regional combination of ingredients and/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager.

The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world.

Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.
