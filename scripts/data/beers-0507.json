Ever since the beginnings of the American Beer Renaissance, I have wanted to brew my own great tasting beer and make it available to the beer drinking public and help people learn about and appreciate beer. Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious. Now after over 200 brews, BCB is in business!\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small, we call it a Nano-Brewery, we are hidden in the middle of 38 acres of woods in the heart of North Carolina. Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be. Our small batch brewing lets us assure you that each keg or bottle of beer will be as fresh and wonderful as though we were brewing it for ourselves to drink.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:55:26", "locations": [{"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "EfLTd6", "locationTypeDisplay": "Nano Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bear Creek", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:56:05", "streetAddress": "10538 NC 902 Hwy", "postalCode": "27207", "website": "http://www.bearcreekbrews.com/", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(919) 200-3930", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.6518126, "locationType": "nano", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -79.3329623, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qz4HmX", "locationTypeDisplay": "Nano Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bear Creek", "createDate": "2014-03-21 12:56:06", "streetAddress": "10538 NC 902 Hwy", "postalCode": "27207", "website": "http://www.bearcreekbrews.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(919) 200-3930", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.6518126, "locationType": "nano", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -79.3329623, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Bear Creek Brews", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:52:57", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9GewxD/upload_lRNESO-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9GewxD/upload_lRNESO-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9GewxD/upload_lRNESO-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9GewxD/upload_lRNESO-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9GewxD/upload_lRNESO-icon.png"}, "id": "9GewxD", "name": "Bear Creek Brews"}], "description": "This Flagship Beer of Bear Creek Brews is a Mild English Style Pale Ale\r\nBut Brewed with the addition of Orange Blossom Honey!\r\n\r\nEnjoy the aroma of fragrant orange blossoms as you enjoy this lightly hopped, full flavored Pale Ale.\r\nWe will brew this same beer using fresh Local Honey or Clover Honey. \r\nEach imparts a distinct aroma and flavor to this easy drinking thirst quencher.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Honey Pale Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/HlaXse/upload_3NWNCn-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/HlaXse/upload_3NWNCn-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/HlaXse/upload_3NWNCn-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DF5YsC", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "streetAddress": "30 Germania Street", "postalCode": "02130", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-372-1131", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.314449, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.103365, "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "MLUbXI", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2013-08-12 13:10:57", "streetAddress": "1625 Central Parkway", "postalCode": "45214", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-412-3200", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Cincinnati", "latitude": 39.1144986, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5222061, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Production Brewery", "locality": "Breinigsville", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.6290377, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 40.5759622, "streetAddress": "7880 Penn Drive", "createDate": "2015-11-30 20:24:56", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2007", "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "postalCode": "18031", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "XZ6L8a", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Boston Beer", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:24:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png"}, "id": "1wSztN", "name": "Boston Beer Company"}], "name": "Honey Queen", "nameDisplay": "Honey Queen", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/57F6lk/upload_xsoe2q-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/57F6lk/upload_xsoe2q-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/57F6lk/upload_xsoe2q-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 12, "name": "Mead, Cider, & Perry"}, "description": "A harmonious blend of mead and beer, with the distinctive characteristics of both.
