Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:27", "shortName": "BBL Aged", "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "createDate": "2013-02-08 11:47:24", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 22:14:17", "abv": "11.5", "styleId": 132, "id": "Xq1Oun", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "A mouth-watering, effervescent Kettle Sour brewed with 100% Riverbend Malt and locally sourced jalape\u00f1os and peaches.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Hot Fuzz (Jalapeno-Peach Sour)", "breweries": [{"website": "http://legionbrewing.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Legion Brewing Company was born from the ethos that sharing good beer with friends is one of life\u2019s great pleasures.
