And history tells of numerous encounters with Rocky, who became a source of great worry and fear.  Although not seen for over a century, divers still experience a feeling of dread and being watched.

But it was a long, long time in the works.  Like any business, there were big ups and downs on the road to the first pour and we think that story is worth sharing.  So here goes....\r\n \r\nJosh Stacy grew up like any other kid in America, playing music, sports, and sharing his space with two siblings.  Totally normal--with one exception.  His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer.  Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby.\r\nJosh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons.   \r\nFast-forward a few years.  Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since).  Even more years went by.  Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer.  Yes, beer.  At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers.  It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers.  Goodridge was hooked.  \r\n\r\nMany weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast.  The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day.  That always loosened the tongue.  Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level.  \r\n\r\nGoodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember.  On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea.  Enough was enough, he told her.  He immediately called Stacy and said, \"I'm coming over to your house.\"  Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth.  \"Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job.\" \r\n\r\nJosh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen.  Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla.  Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous. \r\n\r\nOne week later, all the beer they had made was gone.  It was\r\na hit!  The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map.  Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri.  You are invited to come in and have a pint with us.  Cheers!\r\n \r\nNow that you know our story, we encourage you to come in and share yours.

It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for.

We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "mailingListUrl": "http://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Durham", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "id": "vGotFH", "streetAddress": "107 East Parrish Street", "postalCode": "27701", "extendedAddress": "Suite 105", "website": "http://www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "919-680-2333", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.995445, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -78.899939, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Bull City Burger", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:12:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_OCIvTW-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png"}, "id": "eu1cAn", "name": "Bull City Burger and Brewery"}], "name": "Rogers", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Rogers", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jsDvNV/upload_mqwurw-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jsDvNV/upload_mqwurw-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jsDvNV/upload_mqwurw-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 8, "name": "North American Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "d8IJKF", "locationTypeDisplay": "Office", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Abita Springs", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "streetAddress": "PO Box 1510", "postalCode": "70420", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-737-2311", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 30.4785257, "locationType": "office", "region": "Louisiana", "longitude": -90.0375755, "updateDate": "2015-12-03 19:13:14", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Covington", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "tasting", "region": "Louisiana", "longitude": -90.055185, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "9858933143", "streetAddress": "21084 Louisiana 36", "createDate": "2012-09-29 14:34:50", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-03 19:13:30", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "70433", "latitude": 30.482138, "isPrimary": "N", "id": "PdSE1h", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "1xB2B8", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Abita Springs", "createDate": "2012-09-29 14:36:40", "streetAddress": "72011 Holly Street", "postalCode": "70420", "website": "http://www.abitabrewpub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2004", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(985) 892-5837", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Brewpub", "latitude": 30.4787911, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Louisiana", "longitude": -90.0392975, "updateDate": "2015-12-03 19:14:30", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Abita", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:38:18", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_6HsKvN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_6HsKvN-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_6HsKvN-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_6HsKvN-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BBE5WM/upload_6HsKvN-icon.png"}, "id": "BBE5WM", "name": "Abita Brewing Company"}], "description": "Our roggen weizen is a stronger version of a German hefeweizen with rye malt added.

Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.

It should be brewed with at least 30 percent rye malt, and hop rates will be low.

Color is straw to dark amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. If the beer is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or light caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile.
