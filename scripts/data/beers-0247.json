Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-03-08 20:04:30", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "5R4Akp", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Sheboygan", "createDate": "2012-03-08 20:05:17", "streetAddress": "1327 Huron Ave", "postalCode": "53081", "website": "http://www.3sheepsbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "920-395-3583", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Location", "latitude": 43.7593533, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -87.7225872, "updateDate": "2015-12-03 19:09:17", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "3 Sheeps", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:28:29", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_QJdBdz-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_QJdBdz-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_QJdBdz-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_QJdBdz-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_QJdBdz-icon.png"}, "id": "Hw7H52", "name": "3 Sheeps Brewing Co"}], "description": "Step right up, one and all!

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.
