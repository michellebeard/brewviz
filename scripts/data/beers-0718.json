Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations":

Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:48", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "Qs29uy", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Frederick", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:48", "streetAddress": "124 North Market Street", "postalCode": "21701", "website": "http://www.brewers-alley.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "301-631-0089", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.4156043, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Maryland", "longitude": -77.4107676, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Laurel", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "MD", "longitude": -76.860565, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 39.1426709, "createDate": "2016-03-14 17:43:05", "status": "deleted", "updateDate": "2016-05-01 14:34:43", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "20723", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "RW6Da0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "statusDisplay": "Deleted"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brewer's Alley Restaurant", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:05:53", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_q7kWln-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_q7kWln-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_q7kWln-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_q7kWln-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_q7kWln-icon.png"}, "id": "wFeIiC", "name": "Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery"}], "description": "This seasonal beer was originally a home-brew recipe which one of our former brewers (Edgar Radonich) came up with over several brews.

Every morning I used to say \u201cThis is a new day\u201d and since the first blossoms on the trees were enunciating the coming of spring, I decided to brew a beer to honor the season, rebirth and new beginnings.\r\n To express my vision I decided on a Saison because it is a beer strongly connected to the land. (Saisons are traditionally brewed by the farmers of the Hainaut region in Belgium.)\r\n Although choosing the beer was simple, selecting the herbs and spices was surprisingly difficult. I wanted both to recall the scent of a blooming field and create a fresh, intriguing and easy to drink beer. In order to achieve the right balance of herbs and spices, I remember drinking herbal infusions every day during that winter.\r\n\r\nI had no doubt on the name.
