In 2002, he reintroduced the Fuggle hop which had disappeared since the 40\u2019s in Canada and is now integrated in his recipes. These elements are part of the uniqueness of the Farm Brewery Schoune.\r\n\r\nToday still very attached to the flavours and tastes excellence and the love of the product from its conception up to its production and finally distribution of his artisanal beers, the 300 hectares Farm Brewery Schoune is a regional as well world reference for the quality and originality of its products. \r\n\r\nFarm Brewery Schoune exports under the name of O\u2019Canada.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-03-13 14:19:15", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Tue:  8:30am - 12:00pm\nWed:  8:30am - 12:00pm\nThu:  8:30am - 12:00pm\nFri:  8:30am - 12:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 5:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Saint-Polycarpe", "createDate": "2015-03-13 18:32:13", "id": "QFcQMV", "streetAddress": "2075 Chemin Sainte Catherine", "postalCode": "J0P 1X0", "website": "http://www.schoune.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "phone": "+1 450-265-3765", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 45.3026898, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Qu\u00e9bec", "longitude": -74.3746712, "updateDate": "2015-03-13 18:32:13", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Ferme brasserie Schoune", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:06:00", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iXD5XB/upload_XDvVMJ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iXD5XB/upload_XDvVMJ-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iXD5XB/upload_XDvVMJ-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iXD5XB/upload_XDvVMJ-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iXD5XB/upload_XDvVMJ-icon.png"}, "id": "iXD5XB", "name": "Ferme brasserie Schoune"}], "description": "This flavourful blonde will capture you with its malt bouquet and its sublte peaks of hops.
