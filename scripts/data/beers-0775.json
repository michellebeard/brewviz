Three years into our project and we\u2019re grateful and amazed that so many people love and support great beer these days.  The fact that we\u2019re still here is a credit to you all.\r\n\r\nBut for the question of primary importance: What is the beer? Well, it\u2019s our Pretty Things barleywine.  Inspired by malted barley, a tribute to the barleycorn.  Yes, it\u2019s simple, but that\u2019s what barleywines are all about.  Ever since brewing in England, Dann has dreamed of making a barley-focused beer using the malts of Yorkshire (and never hesitates to plug his favorite: Thomas Fawcett & Sons).  The American version of a barleywine is normally a sad beer indeed, lots of hops and alcohol but the star of the show is left scratching his chin in the eaves of the theatre.  This is not one of those beers.  The English invented this style and they\u2019re the only ones who know how to make one, save the rare American brewer.\r\n\r\nGive barley a chance and this mysterious little grain can do grand things!\r\n\r\nTo get the density of sugars needed for this sort of beer, we employed \u201cdouble mashing\u201d. The brewhouse that we work on can only get to maybe 18 plato for a single running of wort: but we wanted 27 plato! So we combined two brews by running wort into the kettle and then using it to mash in the second batch. We don\u2019t take credit for this idea.  We\u2019re certain it has been done many, many times before.  But it wasn\u2019t until Will Meyers (the great Cantabridgian Cervecero) brought this method to our attention that we realized we could brew a barleywine of proper gravity\u2026 (he never told us that he hadn\u2019t actually performed this sort of brewing before!). Anyway, it works!!\r\n\r\nExpect an aroma of juicy sultanas, wet wood, green apple, malted milk balls, marzipan and alcohol deliciousness. It\u2019s got a medium body and is a little more spritsy than we\u2019re sure the Brits would like. Serve over 50 degrees fahrenheit in a stemmed glass.\r\n\r\nVery suitable to drink this year or next, or even the winter after that!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Our Finest Regards", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LMPeqi/upload_XsosKI-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LMPeqi/upload_XsosKI-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LMPeqi/upload_XsosKI-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.116", "name": "Our Finest Regards", "servingTemperature": "cool", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 10, "name": "Oversized Wine Glass"}, "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cool - (8-12C/45-54F)", "createDate": "2012-04-23 19:25:19", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 17:26:18", "abv": "11", "styleId": 34, "availableId": 4, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.09", "description": "American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity.

In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.struisebrouwers.be/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Woesten", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "West-Vlaanderen", "countryIsoCode": "BE", "longitude": 2.7831, "country": {"displayName": "Belgium", "name": "BELGIUM", "isoThree": "BEL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 56, "isoCode": "BE"}, "isClosed": "N", "streetAddress": "Woesten", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2001", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "latitude": 50.900311, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qcAp7N", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "De Struise", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:44:16", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png"}, "id": "bjwFtZ", "name": "De Struise"}, {"website": "http://www.stillwaterales.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "\"A sincere artist is not one who makes a faithful attempt to put on to canvas what is in front of him, but one who tries to create something which is, in itself, a living thing.\" -Sir William Dobell\r\n\r\nThe goal of Stillwater Artisanal is just that, living art.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.
