Its inspiration is found more than 200 years ago. Zeitgeist takes an age old classic, a forgotten masterpiece and gives it relevance and an avant-garde edge. Zeitgeist encapsulates our view of contemporary society, yet simultaneously endeavours to improve it. There is too much conformity. Not enough thought, not enough individualism, not enough alternatives. Our military line ups represent conformity to a higher authority, be it political, brand, celebrity, religion or trend. The subjects in our dystopian landscape further seek to repress their identity through uniforms and masks. Yet underneath their body shapes reveal cracks of personality and individualism. Zeitgeist is about identity, non-conformity and idiosyncrasy. It is a collective, an idea, a movement. It is about giving up ownership of itself to those who care enough to listen.", "srmId": 33, "nameDisplay": "Zeitgeist", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vgXDMr/upload_h73JZ1-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vgXDMr/upload_h73JZ1-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/vgXDMr/upload_h73JZ1-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.036", "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.
