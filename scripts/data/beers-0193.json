By the early 1980s, the last one had shuttered its doors. So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cleveland", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "id": "8dIvZw", "streetAddress": "1947 West 28th Street", "postalCode": "44113", "website": "http://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1988", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "216-771-4404", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.484295, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -81.705375, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cleveland", "createDate": "2013-12-10 17:48:32", "id": "xSmsLL", "streetAddress": "2516 Market Avenue", "postalCode": "44113", "website": "http://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/brewpub/around-the-brewpub", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "216-771-4404", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Great Lakes Brewpub", "latitude": 41.484446, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -81.704436, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Great Lakes", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-10-19 04:41:40", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uSFO4T/upload_JF7uqw-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uSFO4T/upload_JF7uqw-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uSFO4T/upload_JF7uqw-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uSFO4T/upload_JF7uqw-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uSFO4T/upload_JF7uqw-icon.png"}, "id": "uSFO4T", "name": "Great Lakes Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.056", "description": "American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival.

Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes.

In 1930 they build a new malt house and a foeder room and in 1937 a new brewing room, a fermentation room, a tank room and a bottling hall. Their focus still is on the traditional low fermentation beers: bock, export and lager.\r\nLuc, the son of Paul, goes to brewery school and learns the trade as an apprentice in Germany and Wallonia.\r\nLuc takes over in 1953, changes the name in brewery Vanhonsebrouck and decides to stop brewing lager and focuses on \u2018old Flemish brown\u2019, Bacchus.\r\nIn 1957 he starts with lambic and later on with Gueuze and Kriek under the name Saint Louis. Brewery Vanhonsebrouck becomes the second largest brewery of Gueuze, thanks to the shirt sponsoring of FC Bruges, European soccer finalist in 1976 and 1978. The production of Gueuze Saint Louis booms to a record in that time of 1 million kg of malt.\r\nIn 1980 Luc responds to the growing demand for heavy blond beers and launches Brigand, named after the farmer\u2019s uprising against French occupation in 1798.\r\nIn 1986 the family buys Ingelmunster castle and 3 years later, the famous Kasteel(bier) is launched.

We produce inspired ales, with lots of care, in very small batches.\r\n\r\nOur custom built, 3BBL brew-house ensures a keen eye to every detail and fosters creativity in both our recipes and beer styles.\r\n\r\nDandy Ales are living beers; naturally conditioned bottles, kegs, and casks. This return to the true ale tradition ensures the living yeast in the unfiltered and unpasteurized beer will continue to work with the premium malt and complex hops from the moment it is pitched in the fermenters, until it passes your lips!\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to offer a top notch tasting room on site where you can taste any or all of our eight taps, including Dandy favourites and special one-off beers. There are also tours and a small shop to pick up a variety of Dandy merchandise!\r\n\r\nWe share a passion for not only brewing, but the people, process, experiences, and personal touches that make the real ale experience so special.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-04-06 17:27:32", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Sat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 4:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\n\nMonday-Wednesday: Closed\r\nThursday: 4pm-8pm\r\nFriday: 4pm-10pm\r\nSaturday: Noon-10pm\r\nSunday: Noon-4pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Nano Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Calgary", "createDate": "2016-04-06 17:27:33", "id": "K6PeNv", "streetAddress": "#11 1826 25TH AVENUE NE", "postalCode": "T2E 7K1", "website": "http://thedandybrewingcompany.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "phone": "+1 403-769-9399", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 51.0751355, "locationType": "nano", "region": "AB", "longitude": -114.0147848, "updateDate": "2016-05-07 15:07:46", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "The Dandy", "updateDate": "2016-05-07 15:11:07", "id": "wjSS57", "name": "The Dandy Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.036", "description": "English Summer Ale is light straw to golden colored with medium-low to medium bitterness, light to medium-light body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness.

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection.
