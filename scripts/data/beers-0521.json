At Brothers Drake, our philosophy on making mead is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\n1. Start Local: We buy local honey, support local agriculture, and produce a local product.\r\n\r\n2. Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices. We look forward to sharing a drink with you!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:48", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "0Y6wSh", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Columbus", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:48", "streetAddress": "26 E. 5th Avenue", "postalCode": "43201", "website": "http://brothersdrake.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "614-388-8765", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.987311, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -83.004595, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brothers Drake Meadery", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:11:09", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_g95Ivt-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_g95Ivt-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_g95Ivt-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_g95Ivt-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_g95Ivt-icon.png"}, "id": "IEFRaK", "name": "Brothers Drake Meadery"}], "description": "Traditional beer technique in combination with mead makes this the beer lover\u2019s wine.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C.

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.

However, even \u201ccheap\u201d was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn\u2019t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed.

We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won\u2019t likely fix our present model. \r\n\r\nSo that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the \u201chate\u201d column\u2014ant that\u2019s always one that someone else places in the \u201clove\u201d column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:55", "mailingListUrl": "http://www.furthermorebeer.com/mailing-list", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "SY2b6E", "locationTypeDisplay": "Office", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Spring Green", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:55", "streetAddress": "525 East Madison Street", "postalCode": "53588", "extendedAddress": "PO Box 776", "website": "http://www.furthermorebeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-588-3300", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 43.1754057, "locationType": "office", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -90.0616834, "updateDate": "2016-09-16 13:26:18", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Furthermore Beer", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:19:24", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_pzSlep-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_pzSlep-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_pzSlep-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_pzSlep-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_pzSlep-icon.png"}, "id": "JuFsla", "name": "Furthermore Beer"}], "description": "All of the hops for this beer were obtained from Wisconsin, from the Magna Cum Lately straight-A geeks of all things lupine (that means hoppy), Gorst Valley Hops.

These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers.
