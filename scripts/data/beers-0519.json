For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer important how advanced we are and how much technical support we use during our daily processes. The most important aspect for us is that we keep our traditional heritage. As we know the saying \"New is not in comparison with the word better\".\r\n\r\nThe Schlossbrauerei Au-Halltertau respects the tradition and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally. The first documented brew master was the royal court brew master named \"Schweiger\" in 1590. At that time the Noble Freiherr Baron von Thurn was the lord of the castle. He was the fourth noble lord since 990 a.d through 1281 a.d that ruled in Au Hallertau.\r\n\r\nSince 1846 the Noble rulers and Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz have ruled and resided in the magnificent \"Moated Castle\" in Au i.d. Hallertau.\r\n\r\nThe noble family of Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz is still living in the castle an in the meantime it is the 6th generation.\r\n\r\nAt present Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz is making sure that the Castle Brewery stays a traditional brewery together with the necessary vision into the future to create a sustainable traditional premium quality future.\r\n\r\nMichael Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz\u2019s utmost desire is not to miss a successful sustainable future and at the same time to keep up the 6 generations of writing a successful historical event for the Castle brewery and it history.\r\n\r\nThe Brew Master Mr. Stefan Ebensperger is supporting the Baron with his highly qualified experience and skills. The necessary emotions and bindings towards a brewing heritage that has been passed down for generations is needed. Tradition is naturally one of the highest priorities for Mr. Ebensperger due to our traditional purity laws dating back to 1516 a.d therefore you can be assured that the quality is a premium German and he says, \"It will also stay like that\". Since 1516 the Bavarians have known how important the quality of the ingredients and the brewing process actually are. Beer was known during the Middle Ages as the same significant value as bread. As a part of the staple die, it was also germ free and full of healthy calories. During that time the average citizen spent a good 20 percent of their income on beer.\r\n\r\nOn the 23. April 1516 the Bavaria Duke Wilhelm IV.

In 1918 the Weimarer Republik accepted the Bavarian purity law into its republic, therefore the Bavarian purity then became a German law.

Well, it\u2019s because we did an old-school, big boy cereal mash to give it exceptionally light body (for an 8% abv beer). A cereal mash uses corn grits, which are not really a craft brewing thing.

(one of which in this case was clogging up our lauter tun big time\u2026 but we\u2019ll come to that).

Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DF5YsC", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "streetAddress": "30 Germania Street", "postalCode": "02130", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-372-1131", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.314449, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.103365, "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "MLUbXI", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2013-08-12 13:10:57", "streetAddress": "1625 Central Parkway", "postalCode": "45214", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-412-3200", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Cincinnati", "latitude": 39.1144986, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5222061, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Production Brewery", "locality": "Breinigsville", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.6290377, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 40.5759622, "streetAddress": "7880 Penn Drive", "createDate": "2015-11-30 20:24:56", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2007", "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "postalCode": "18031", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "XZ6L8a", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Boston Beer", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:24:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png"}, "id": "1wSztN", "name": "Boston Beer Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
