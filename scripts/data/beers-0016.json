Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:09", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "MfINpl", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Atlanta", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:09", "streetAddress": "195 Ottley Drive", "postalCode": "30324", "website": "http://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "404-691-2537", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.808102, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Georgia", "longitude": -84.38119, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "SweetWater", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-08-23 15:00:55", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-icon.png"}, "id": "TMc6H2", "name": "SweetWater Brewing Company"}], "description": "SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale, our most popular brew, is a tasty West Coast-style pale ale with a stimulating hop character and a crisp finish. 1st brewed on April 20th 1997.\r\n\r\nGrains \u2013 Munich, 40L, 2-Row\r\nHops \u2013 Centennial, Cascade\r\n\r\nAwards \u2013 2002 Silver Medal- Great American Beer Festival, 1997 \u2013 2005 Creative Loafing Readers Choice \u2013 Best local beer, 1998 World Beer Cup silver medal, Top 10 Local beers \u2013 Atlanta Journal Constitution", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "420 Extra Pale Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/NoNhan/upload_FgWgmB-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/NoNhan/upload_FgWgmB-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/NoNhan/upload_FgWgmB-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
