A small, windowless apartment where Matt would brew beer by day and sleep on the floor by night, with lamps on timers to remind him when wake up and do it all over again.\r\nPhillips\u2019 first brews were about as unconventional as his financing structure.  In the conservative beer climate of 2001 the brewery launched with an Espresso Stout, a Raspberry Wheat Ale, and a boldy-hopped IPA;  a suitable foreshadow for the creativity to come.\r\nSince then Phillips has moved out of the apartment and into a more brewing-appropriate facility (with windows) closer to town.

At least one regional combination of ingredients and/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:56", "shortName": "BBL Aged Sour", "id": 136, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer"}, "id": "dHnbxN", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.countryboybrewing.com/", "established": "2011", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Country Boy Brewing was founded in late 2011 by three country boys who like beer and had a similar goal of making and drinking good beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-04-15 19:40:13", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon-Wed: 4PM - 10PM\r\nThu-Fri: 4PM-Midnight\r\nSat: Noon - Midnight\r\nSun: 1PM - 9PM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Lexington", "createDate": "2012-04-15 19:41:03", "id": "W4JNkr", "streetAddress": "436 Chair Street", "postalCode": "40508", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "859-554-6200", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.043848, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Kentucky", "longitude": -84.508801, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Country Boy", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:28:57", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/o9yWqF/upload_4DzKdD-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/o9yWqF/upload_4DzKdD-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/o9yWqF/upload_4DzKdD-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/o9yWqF/upload_4DzKdD-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/o9yWqF/upload_4DzKdD-icon.png"}, "id": "o9yWqF", "name": "Country Boy Brewing"}], "name": "Amos Moses", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Amos Moses", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/7o06Ql/upload_aul5le-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/7o06Ql/upload_aul5le-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/7o06Ql/upload_aul5le-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
