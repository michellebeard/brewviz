Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:21:11", "fgMax": "1.028", "shortName": "Scotch Ale", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "id": "bL7eDZ", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:44", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 05:51:44", "abv": "10.2", "styleId": 15, "availableId": 2, "glasswareId": 8, "ibu": "50", "srm": {"hex": "660D00", "id": 29, "name": "29"}, "name": "Backwoods Bastard"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available at the same time of year, every year.", "id": 4, "name": "Seasonal"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Backwoods Belgian is an 8.5% ABV Belgian-Style Golden Ale brewed with a \u201cSouthern\u201d infusion of Honeysuckle flowers.
