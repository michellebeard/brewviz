The special yeast used in brewing this beer creates flavors of spices, notably nutmeg and clove and bright fruit notes to accompany. An element of malt sweetness comes in to balance the yeast notes. The beer finishes with a bright carbonation and a crisp dryness.\r\n\r\nThe Saison style originated in the France/Belgian border region of Wallonia. Saison is not a single style, but more a family of beers. They were originally made in small farmhouse breweries and could vary greatly in color & flavor from farm to farm. The word \u201csaison\u201d means \u201cseason\u201d in French and Saison beers were usually brewed seasonally and used as payment & fortification for seasonal farm laborers known as \u201csaisonnaires\u201d. Many of the original Saison beers were produced in conditions that allowed wild yeasts to colonize them and impart flavors. These Brettanomyces yeasts are now being used by modern brewers to help replicate some of the flavors of the past. We age our Amber Saison in oak barrels with added Brettanomyces for a special fall release in our Barrel Roll Series that we call Falling Leaf.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Amber Saison", "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cold - (4-7C/39-45F)", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.055", "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.
