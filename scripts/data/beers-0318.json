This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.

Here is a little rundown about what Fifty West is all about:\r\n\r\nAll the beers brewed at Fifty West Brewing Company have been hand made in small batches with a focus on craftsmanship, tradition, innovation, and patience.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why we selected the name \u2018Fifty West\u2019; the most obvious being the fact that our brewery is located on Route 50, which extends from Coast to Coast- it spans more than 3,000 miles starting in Maryland and stretching all the way to California. \r\n\r\nThe brewery is located in a building that has a vast and varied transient history (http://www.cincinnati.com/dining/heritage/history.html); from the settlers heading west through the Ohio River valley, to the days of Prohibition when our building was a favorite of George Remus and the bootleggers running whiskey from Cincinnati to Chicago, to where we are today\u2014amidst a renaissance of the craft beer movement.\r\n\r\nTo us, it\u2019s not about the destination, but instead making sure we are enjoying the journey, appreciating the moment, and brewing beers that are enjoyed by anyone who is willing to let us become a part of their journey.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-10-25 12:10:16", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qa1QZU", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2012-10-25 12:10:46", "streetAddress": "7668 Wooster Pike", "postalCode": "45227", "website": "http://www.fiftywestbrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(440) 477-0163", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.138724, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.353144, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Fifty West", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-07-02 12:52:20", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/832aZM/upload_6Rv25q-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/832aZM/upload_6Rv25q-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/832aZM/upload_6Rv25q-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/832aZM/upload_6Rv25q-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/832aZM/upload_6Rv25q-icon.png"}, "id": "832aZM", "name": "Fifty West Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel. Coriander and light orange peel aroma should be perceived as such or as an unidentified spiciness. Phenolic spiciness and yeast flavors may be evident at mild levels. These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "10", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "4", "ibuMax": "17", "abvMin": "4.8", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:32:30", "fgMax": "1.01", "shortName": "Witbier", "abvMax": "5.2", "id": 65, "srmMin": "2", "name": "Belgian-Style White (or Wit) / Belgian-Style Wheat"}, "id": "DDaLYE", "createDate": "2015-12-07 14:32:44", "updateDate": "2015-12-07 14:32:44", "abv": "5.5", "styleId": 65, "ibu": "20", "name": "Doom Pedal"}]
