It had a very mom and pop feel, and featured a look that was as traditional as it gets. Those who knew of it visited regularly, but the regulars were few. For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing. \r\n\r\nThe word started getting out.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:58", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "xZTJW3", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ellensburg", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:58", "streetAddress": "1000 Prospect Street", "postalCode": "98926", "extendedAddress": "Suite 4", "website": "http://www.ironhorsebrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2004", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "509-933-3134", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 46.9994703, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -120.5648701, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Iron Horse", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:04:41", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_V7RJjR-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_V7RJjR-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_V7RJjR-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_V7RJjR-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_V7RJjR-icon.png"}, "id": "ni4EnY", "name": "Iron Horse Brewery"}], "description": "Its like an imperial IPA with a big malt body.

This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it.

We foster a team oriented management style. We offer an excellent casual, yet professional, dining experience for our guests, never pretentious, emphasizing \"fun & friendly... brewpub style\" menu selections and service. We are high-volume, fast paced and right in the middle of all the action for the dozens of events that take place right outside our doorstep on Prescott's hometown Courthouse Plaza. We are community minded and involved in many local events and fundraisers. Our kitchen is a 99% scratch kitchen, providing a large & varied menu. Our bar is lively and we attract people of all ages and backgrounds. We are hands-on owners and look for managers with the same philosophy.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re also pleased to announce that Prescott Brewing Company, the MICROBREWERY, is now an extension of our brewery operations!  With the introduction of PBC\u2019s Liquid Amber Ale and Ponderosa IPA in cans, we quickly outgrew our little 7-barrel brewhouse that\u2019s been our workhorse since opening in 1994.  So we bit the bullet and built an off-site microbrewery production plant out by the Prescott airport in 2011.  The first 30-barrel batch of Liquid Amber was brewed by John and Lead Brewer, Jan, on December 27th, 2011 and was a true better- late- than- never Christmas gift!  Look for both brands increasingly available throughout Arizona.  And thus the story continues.  \r\n\r\nPBC celebrated its 20TH ANNIVERSARY downtown Prescott in March of 2014\u2026.thanks to our many loyal supporters, locals and visitors alike. 20 years of hard labor...nah, not that bad, but 20 years in the restaurant business is a LONG time!  So, we\u2019ll just keep on keepin\u2019 on and are excited to expand the selection of canned product for distribution as production allows out at the airport location.\r\n\r\nYOU are included amongst those who've allowed us to thrive, contribute to our community and keep 65-75 employees on staff all year long! As everyone knows, these have been difficult times for many. We believe every one of us knows personally of someone who has struggled these past few years with job loss, or a small business owner who has had to lay off a good employee, or maybe has had to close their business. Luckily, PBC is okay, thanks to YOU. Not to say we wouldn\u2019t want more of the dining dollars out there...but we\u2019re extremely grateful for the continued support of those in our community and visitors from literally all over the world. We\u2019d like to remind everyone that each of us can make a difference in our communities by shopping local, supporting locally-owned, independent businesses, supporting our local charities and non-profits and volunteering for our favorite causes.

Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.
