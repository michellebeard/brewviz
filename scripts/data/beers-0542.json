George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey.

The original Downtown location opened in November 1994 and expanded with the addition of a pool hall in 1996. The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011. In November 2010, the fifth Great Dane began operations in Grandview commons, off of Cottage Grove Road on Madison's east side.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "mailingListUrl": "http://www.greatdanepub.com/email-list-signup", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday- Thursday 11AM-2AM, Friday-Saturday 11AM-230AM, Sunday 10AM-2AM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Fitchburg", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "IdIInN", "streetAddress": "2980 Cahill Main", "postalCode": "53711", "website": "http://fitchburg.greatdanepub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-442-9000", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Fitchburg", "latitude": 43.0177229, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -89.423194, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday 11AM-2AM,Friday 11AM-2:30AM, Saturday 10AM-2:30AM on Farmer's Market and Home Football Saturdays,11AM-2:30AM other Saturdays, Sunday 10AM-2AM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Madison", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "ux16wo", "streetAddress": "123 E.

When Reuben and I took Adam to Bob\u2019s (our friendly, neighborhood homebrew supply store) to pick up his kit, I was expecting to pick up a little tin of \u201cbeer mix\u201d and a bucket to brew.  We were a bit surprised and overwhelmed by the seriousness of this beer-brewing business.  I thought, \u201cOh great, there\u2019s more storage space gone once Adam gives up on this little hobby in a month\u2019s time.\u201d  Even though I rarely admit to being wrong now that we\u2019re married, I couldn\u2019t have been farther from the mark thinking that this would be an easily discarded hobby.  The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!
