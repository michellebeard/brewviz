Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle\u2019s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "krIs45", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Juneau", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:43", "streetAddress": "5429 Shaune Dr", "postalCode": "99801-9540", "website": "http://www.alaskanbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "907-780-5866", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Location", "latitude": 58.3570171, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alaska", "longitude": -134.4893459, "updateDate": "2015-12-03 19:08:04", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Alaskan", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:38:23", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_psVrqV-icon.png"}, "id": "VPHkaP", "name": "Alaskan Brewing Co."}], "srm": {"hex": "000000", "id": 41, "name": "Over 40"}, "updateDate": "2015-12-16 18:57:52", "ibu": "50", "createDate": "2012-09-29 20:53:18"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "Y", "description": "Our take on the Trappist tradition includes adding exotic spices to this golden ale \u2014 their subtle earthiness rounds the notes of citrus and ripe bananas to create a complex, yet smooth ale.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Persian Tripel", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.penrosebrewing.com/", "established": "2013", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Art, Science, and Belgian-Inspired Brewing in Geneva, IL. \r\n\r\nThis began with a shared obsession for skillfully brewed beer, and the starved need for cultural redirection of our lifework.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.
