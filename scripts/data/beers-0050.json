Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

They devised a plan to build a brewery in beautiful Birmingham \u2013 Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe group found an excellent location for the brewery in the Pepper Place/Lakeview district of Birmingham on 3rd Avenue South.  The 8000 Square foot building houses the brewery and tasting room.  The building was selected for it\u2019s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Cahaba Brewing Company has had the goal of providing Birmingham with clean and consistent craft beers with a broad variety flavors and styles.  To do this, CBC hand selected and assembled the brewing equipment necessary for the job.  As luck would have it, our friends at Straight To Ale, in Huntsville, AL were in the process of upgrading their brewery and they had just purchased all of the equipment from Old Town Brewery.  After purchasing their equipment, we were just about ready to go.  The set-up consists of a Premier Stainless 3.5 bbl brewhouse outfitted with four 7 bbl fermenters and two 7 bbl brite tanks.\r\n\r\nCahaba continued to grow and found a new location to begin the expansion process in early 2015. Celebrating \"Last Pint Night\" at the original 3rd Ave South location in mid-January 2016, the new 51,000 square foot building, located in the Historical Continental Gin, is ready to open. First day to officially open was January 19th, 2016. Not only is the space much larger, the production facility is also expanding from a 3.5 bbl brewhouse to a 30 bbl brewhouse. The new set up consists of three 60 bbl brite tanks and one 120 bbl brite tank. In addition, the 3.5 bbl system from the original building will join the larger tanks at the new facility and will be used for smaller batches. Cahaba will also begin canning various styles of beer in-house. These cans will join the already launched American Blonde that went into the local market in early 2015. The new taproom offers a window looking into the production facility, a covered patio, and ample parking. The space is also flexible, offering multiple options for all varieties of private event needs such as weddings, reunions, corporate events, and birthday parties.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-07-21 22:45:16", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "hMvwjg", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Birmingham", "createDate": "2012-07-21 22:46:42", "streetAddress": "4500 5th Ave South", "postalCode": "35222", "extendedAddress": "Building C", "website": "http://cahababrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "205-578-2616", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.526729, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alabama", "longitude": -86.764854, "updateDate": "2016-02-02 17:43:17", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Cahaba", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-02-02 17:39:14", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/63i9qL/upload_D2X7RV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/63i9qL/upload_D2X7RV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/63i9qL/upload_D2X7RV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/63i9qL/upload_D2X7RV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/63i9qL/upload_D2X7RV-icon.png"}, "id": "63i9qL", "name": "Cahaba Brewing Company"}], "description": "American Blonde Ale is our lightest ale, with a clean and crisp flavor and an unmistakable blend of American and European malts and hops.

A lot of our beers have been lovingly referred to as so finely crafted that they seem to be made for a serious wine drinkers palate. A saying goes in wine making, \"it takes a lot of good beer to make good wine...\". The point being, we make complex, delicate, nuanced beers, not just the same typical west coast hop bombs or dark extremely high alcohol brews (though we make quality versions of those too). Our goal is to show the whole spectrum of beer, its history, and its evolution. To show beer its proper reverence, as not only \"The people's beverage\", but one that pairs as well with food as wine, and when it's skillfully crafted and not over hopped to hide the flaws in production, it does. The truth is, it takes more skill to make a delicate lager, than a double IPA. You would be hard pressed to find anyone more passionate and knowledgeable about beer than myself or my brewer Josh Watterson.
