A caramel and/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "60", "categoryId": 3, "srmMax": "22", "ibuMax": "100", "abvMin": "8.4", "fgMin": "1.024", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:27:08", "fgMax": "1.028", "shortName": "American Barleywine", "abvMax": "12", "id": 34, "srmMin": "11", "name": "American-Style Barley Wine Ale"}, "name": "Massive!", "servingTemperature": "cellar", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 6, "name": "Snifter"}, "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cellar - (12-14C/54-57F)", "createDate": "2013-04-18 11:40:07", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 02:58:11", "abv": "12", "styleId": 34, "availableId": 2, "id": "0lv2Bb", "glasswareId": 6}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Masswhole", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Masswhole", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/fdZ0HS/upload_QMTcBN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/fdZ0HS/upload_QMTcBN-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/fdZ0HS/upload_QMTcBN-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 4, "name": "German Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.047", "description": "The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.
