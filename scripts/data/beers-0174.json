Barley malt and wheat help create a smooth body and attribute a pleasant golden hue while the addition of malted rye and oats brings out a solid earthy flavor.

The subtle hints of tangerine, peach and licorice are the hallmarks of this particular yeast.\r\n\r\nBooyah is a farmhouse ale, which means it\u2019s a kitchen sink type of recipe, so there are no rules when it comes to grain bill, hops or yeast. When it comes to grain, just name it, barley, oats, wheat, rye and corn. The rye malt and oats produce a really earthy smell in the mash. For this ale we use a specific saison ale strain. This yeast has been cultured to produce a lot of fruity and spicy esters, such as apricot, clove, banana and anise. Keeping the a fermentation temperature at 68 degrees controls the ester of the yeast strain. This yeast strain also likes to take its\u2019 time, a long and slow fermentation settles out the finished beer. This is a good sippin\u2019 beer for me. I enjoy a glass when all the work of the day is done. The complexity of this beer re-energizes me.\r\n\r\nThis is a great seasonal beer that we released in the spring the last two years.
