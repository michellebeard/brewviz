That's when the first batches of home-brewed beer began appearing and David's wife Lori began to realize that her husband was forming a lifetime passion.  David's passion would continue to grow and evolve.  He learned the tradition of brewing in America.  The history of small family owned breweries that we able to serve fresh handcrafted beer to their local communities.  The fact that the these small local breweries became points of pride in the community and that the businesses would stay in the family for generations.  \r\n \r\nAn idea began to grow.  The idea that despite the brewing world we live in now with mega breweries pumping out mass marketed bland beer, that a small locally owned brewery making fresh unique beer could again be a source of pride for a community.  David dreamed of recreating this American brewing tradition and so set out on his way to do just that.\r\n \r\nDavid spent the next 7 years honing his craft.  Learning about beer styles and brewing techniques.  Winning contests with his beer and defining a unique style for quality and consistency.  In 2012 the wheels were set into motion for our brewery when David met Tyler Meusburger, a colleague with a passion for entrepreneurship and creativity.  Working together they began building a business plan and putting financing into place, and in Nov of 2013 David and Tyler brewed the first batch of beer at New American Brewing Co.\r\n \r\nWe look forward to continuing our story and living a \"New Tradition\" of American brewing.\r\n \r\nDrink American!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-07-25 14:17:39", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "ZK7bhN", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ankeny", "createDate": "2014-07-25 14:20:32", "streetAddress": "1460 NE 69th Pl Suite 67", "postalCode": "50021", "website": "http://www.newamericanbeer.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "515-250-8703", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.6863399, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Iowa", "longitude": -93.5994046, "updateDate": "2014-07-25 14:20:32", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "New American", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:56:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_95vyk6-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_95vyk6-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_95vyk6-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_95vyk6-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RHn3Pm/upload_95vyk6-icon.png"}, "id": "RHn3Pm", "name": "New American Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.075", "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
