Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.

I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer\u2019s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I\u2019m my own worst critic.  I\u2019m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn\u2019t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.\r\n\r\nSo, after all this research and planning, what\u2019s the plan?  Start small.\r\n\r\nJack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?\r\n\r\nThis little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.  It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment.  Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!  I\u2019ve been my own worst critic for the past 12 years of homebrewing.  Now it\u2019s your turn.  With your help, we can build a brewery to provide our friends and neighbors with delicious locally-brewed beer.\r\n\r\nSo, stop in and give it a try!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-01-16 22:52:53", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Friday 4-7pm\r\nSaturday 4-7pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Brainerd", "createDate": "2014-01-16 22:54:29", "id": "CPYUBy", "streetAddress": "7942 College Rd, Ste 115", "postalCode": "56425", "website": "http://jackpinebrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(218) 270-8072", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Jack Pine Brewery - Taproom", "latitude": 46.3447626, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Minnesota", "longitude": -94.2338287, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Jack Pine", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:50:13", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_QgLu1t-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_QgLu1t-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_QgLu1t-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_QgLu1t-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_QgLu1t-icon.png"}, "id": "3YeQjZ", "name": "Jack Pine Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "English dark mild ales range from deep copper to dark brown (often with a red tint) in color.

We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived.

Founded in 1997 by longtime friends and co-workers Rick Dellow and Barry Benson (the \u2018R\u2019 & \u2018B\u2019, respectively), R&B Brewing Co. was set up to stand in opposition to what the beer world had become \u2013 big, non-descript, faceless, and corporate. Combining over 60 years of brewing experience with some of the big guys, Rick and Barry sought to create deliciously hand crafted ales and lagers that would bear no resemblance to the world of big beer. Full-bodied and distinctly rich beer, using only the choicest malts, hops and yeast, would be the focus of the product, while the co-owners personalities would blend to create the marketing milieu \u2013 edgy, young, independent\u2026definitely East Van.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "g9JaLp", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Vancouver", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "streetAddress": "54 East 4th Ave.", "postalCode": "V5T 1E8", "website": "http://www.r-and-b.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "phone": "1-604-874-2537", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 49.267381, "locationType": "micro", "region": "British Columbia", "longitude": -123.103715, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "R&B", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:55:29", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/2vIPMI/upload_pip4sx-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/2vIPMI/upload_pip4sx-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/2vIPMI/upload_pip4sx-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/2vIPMI/upload_pip4sx-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/2vIPMI/upload_pip4sx-icon.png"}, "id": "2vIPMI", "name": "R&B Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
