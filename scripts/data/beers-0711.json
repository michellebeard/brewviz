With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "lAcrbq", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Gadsden", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "streetAddress": "200 North 6th St.", "postalCode": "35901", "website": "http://www.backfortybeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "256-467-4912", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 34.015484, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alabama", "longitude": -86.005585, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Back Forty", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:06:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-icon.png"}, "id": "KkUzjZ", "name": "Back Forty Beer Company"}], "description": "Naked Pig is a delightfully crisp, hand crafted ale.
