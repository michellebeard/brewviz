Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer.

This one is called Hopfenpop and will start shipping to accounts on Monday August 3rd.\r\nWe are calling this a \u201cpre-prohibition double IPA\u201d, part of a new series we\u2019re calling \u201cNever Upon a Time\u201d.\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d, you ask? Well, it\u2019s because we did an old-school, big boy cereal mash to give it exceptionally light body (for an 8% abv beer). A cereal mash uses corn grits, which are not really a craft brewing thing. In fact, we couldn\u2019t buy them from any of our regular suppliers, such is their \u201cbig beer\u201d stigma. Well, they have their uses! (one of which in this case was clogging up our lauter tun big time\u2026 but we\u2019ll come to that). The use of a cereal mash allows us to bring down the color and body of the beer, while keeping the ABV and allowing us to hop the beer \u201cstupidly.\u201d\r\nSo, we present to you a pale yellow, 8% abv, low bodied, refreshing, double IPA. The words refreshing and double IPA don\u2019t ordinarily go together, but we think you will agree they do here.\r\nThe hops are Mosaic and Sorachi Ace. And there\u2019s plenty of them. High aroma, fairly high bitterness.\r\nA good high-summer, hot-as-mars kind of a beer.\r\nThe name, of course, is Germany-inspired, and we might wear our lederhosen to the launch party.
