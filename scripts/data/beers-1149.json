Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance.
