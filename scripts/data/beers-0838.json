At Community Beer Company we appreciate this timeless, quaffable beer style and will bring it to you year round as our \u201cPublic Ale.\u201d  In reverence to the best ESB\u2019s of England, we brew it with nearly all English ingredients: 100% English malts, a blend of English, German and American hops, our house ale English yeast strain and of course our own crystal clear, filtered water.  The subtle complexities of this beer begin with a base of 100% Maris Otter English pale malt \u2013 prized for its superior, rich, bready taste \u2013 which adds a malt complexity that is difficult to achieve with modern, higher yielding malt varieties.  English crystal malt increases the malt complexity, brings amber color and some residual sweetness, all of which mingles well with the fully expressed fruity esters developed by our house ale yeast during fermentation.

Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.
