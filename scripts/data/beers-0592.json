At opening we plan to have 18 positions available with that number doubling year to year. Our long term goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds of local workers.\r\n\r\nKeeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries; and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown hops and malt. And it doesn\u2019t stop there! We are actively negotiating and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction and website operations with Michigan companies.\r\n\r\nWhere it is not possible to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States. We call this an inside-out sourcing philosophy. First source at the city level and slowly work out by county, state, region and country. We feel this benefits everyone in this endeavor where we support the community that is supporting us. A Win-Win for everyone!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s All About the Beer!\r\n\r\nWe are going to be creating quality; handcrafted beers that we believe will be some of the best beer you have ever tried.
