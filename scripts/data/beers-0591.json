Named \u201cBest Brewery in Chicago\u201d by Chicago Magazine (August 2002), Flossmoor Station features a gleaming glass-enclosed brewery where guests can watch how its fine handcrafted beers are made. (Tours are available upon request). The brewery has won dozens of local, national and international brewing industry honors in only ten years \u2013 a distinction not lost on micro-brew aficionados. \r\n\r\nSome of its more notable awards include being named Best Small Brewpub and Best Small Brewpub Brewer in America at the 2006 Great American Beer FestivalTM and winning gold, silver and bronze medals. Gold and silver medals were also awarded at the 2006 World Beer Cup. In addition, Flossmoor Station Brewery consistently receives top honors and recognition from the Real Ale Festival, Festival of Barrel Aged Beers and the Chicago Beer Society.\r\n\r\nProduced entirely on-site, Flossmoor Station Brewing Company\u2019s beers are handcrafted from the finest ingredients available, brewed in small batches with close attention to detail, and transferred to storage tanks in Flossmoor Station\u2019s beer cellar until its flavor is at its peak. When a customer orders a pint of beer \r\nupstairs at the massive oak bar, that lucky patron is assured of getting the freshest pint of brew money can buy. \r\n\r\nEight different beers round out the selection of \u201cThe Great Eight House Beers\u201d which are offered on a regular basis at Flossmoor Station. In addition, beer enthusiasts look forward to the \u201cBrewmaster\u2019s Specials\u201d which are offered in limited batches, including some seasonal favorites.

That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.
