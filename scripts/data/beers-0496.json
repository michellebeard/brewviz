Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:56", "shortName": "BBL Aged Sour", "id": 136, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer"}, "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 10, "name": "Oversized Wine Glass"}, "glasswareId": 10, "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cellar - (12-14C/54-57F)", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.commonwealthbrewingcompany.com/", "established": "2015", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Local family owned, full production brewery housed inside a fully renovated, former fire and rescue station in Virginia Beach.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-01-27 00:19:46", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Virginia Beach", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "tasting", "region": "Virginia", "longitude": -76.131936, "hoursOfOperation": "Mon-Thur 3pm \u2013 10pm\r\n\r\nFri 3pm \u2013 12am\r\n\r\nSat 12pm \u2013 12am\r\n\r\nSun 12pm \u2013 9pm", "isClosed": "N", "phone": "757.305.9652", "streetAddress": "2444 Pleasure House Rd.", "createDate": "2016-01-29 20:47:44", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-01-29 20:47:57", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "latitude": 36.913509, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "4qK2zX", "locationTypeDisplay": "Tasting Room", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Commonwealth", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-01-29 20:49:10", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0sr0Zy/upload_CpNvSj-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0sr0Zy/upload_CpNvSj-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0sr0Zy/upload_CpNvSj-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0sr0Zy/upload_CpNvSj-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0sr0Zy/upload_CpNvSj-icon.png"}, "id": "0sr0Zy", "name": "Commonwealth Brewing Co."}], "ibu": "9", "servingTemperature": "cellar", "updateDate": "2016-07-18 19:28:14", "createDate": "2016-07-12 15:22:41"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.lonepeakbrewery.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Lone Peak Brewery is located in the Meadow Village Center, next to the Big Sky Post Office and Country Market.
