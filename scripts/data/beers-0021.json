Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.

If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile.

As usual, he took this move with seriousness and intensity . . . while having a blast!\r\n\r\nAfter researching the art of brewing, he discovered that contrary to the perceived image of brewers, the occupation required a variety of skills beyond drinking a lot. So, Jem decided to get a hospitality and management degree from F.I.U. in Florida and at the same time practiced and fine-tuned his brewing (and drinking) skills in his makeshift home brewery.\r\n\r\nThe next stop was a surprise- U.C. Davis in California to study Microbiology and The Advanced Sciences of Brewing. \u201cTo make perfect beer you need to understand the science of beer\u201d, he would convince himself during mind-numbing chemistry and advanced sanitation classes.\r\n\r\nTo further quench his thirst for brewing knowledge and skills, Jem upped the ante and applied to Chicago\u2019s Siebel Institute of Technology, the Mecca for beer industry education and way station for some of the world\u2019s renowned brew masters. However, to his amazement, he was rejected.\r\n\r\nRejection didn\u2019t stand in his way. Jem clenched his teeth and pushed forward understanding that to be accepted to the revered institute he would need some serious brewing experience. The next stop was as an assistant brewer at Oxford Brewing Company of Maryland. A year and a half and many bags of grain later, Jem was accepted to Siebel where he completed his academic studies, hung out with Budweiser and Coors Jr., and gained 10 kilos.\r\n\r\nArmed with a battery of diplomas and experience, Jem continued to execute his plan with determination. He immigrated to Israel with his wife, two kids, five thousand dollars, and a dream of producing premium fresh beer in the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nHere Dan came into the picture. Dan, a lawyer and entrepreneur originally from New York, heard about this strange pioneer with an overwhelming passion for beer and people, and was intrigued. The two met for a beer, the hops sparked and the deal was struck- Jem and Dan would establish a factory for fresh beer in Israel.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe it wasn\u2019t that easy. The journey was long and arduous, full of bureaucracy, business plans, searching for locations in dubious industrial zones, and mainly naysayers and skeptics who couldn\u2019t understand what these two Americans were trying to do.\r\n\r\nFinally, after extensive wanderings, they found an old factory in a dusty corner of Petach Tikva\u2019s industrial zone. Where others would have turned their backs, the two saw the potential and decided that the dream will turn to reality at number 15 Hamagshimim Street.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-06-12 23:46:14", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "IL", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Petah Tiqwa", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Hamerkaz", "longitude": 34.8922451, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+972 3-919-5367", "streetAddress": "15 Hamagshimim Street", "createDate": "2016-06-28 15:00:35", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-28 15:00:50", "country": {"displayName": "Israel", "name": "ISRAEL", "isoThree": "ISR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 376, "isoCode": "IL"}, "latitude": 32.1800086, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "Onv9LT", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Jem's Beer Factory", "updateDate": "2016-06-28 14:49:30", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JDJ6aI/upload_3n3UJ3-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JDJ6aI/upload_3n3UJ3-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JDJ6aI/upload_3n3UJ3-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JDJ6aI/upload_3n3UJ3-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JDJ6aI/upload_3n3UJ3-icon.png"}, "id": "JDJ6aI", "name": "Jem's Beer Factory"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.07", "description": "Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style export ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style export ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style export ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "15", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "25", "abvMin": "4", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:56", "fgMax": "1.018", "shortName": "Scottish Export", "abvMax": "5.3", "id": 9, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Export Ale"}, "createDate": "2015-04-09 11:53:33", "updateDate": "2015-04-09 11:53:33", "abv": "4", "styleId": 9, "id": "vdu24G", "name": "80/- (eighty shilling)"}]
