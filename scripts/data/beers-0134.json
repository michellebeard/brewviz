With the help of Birreria Brother Brewers Leo DeVencenzo of Birra del Borgo and Teo Musso of Baladin, they analyzed drinking vessels found in 2,800-year-old Etruscan tombs.\r\n \r\nAlthough Italian historians were a little reluctant to admit it, the team clearly found that the Etruscans had a taste for ale.\r\n \r\n\"In every part of the process, we go for as much authenticity as we can,\" Calagione says. \"Ingredients are often tough to track down, and there can be financial and logistical challenges, but we really love embracing these risks to bring these beers to market.\"\r\n \r\nThe backbone of Birra Etrusca comes from two-row malted barley and an heirloom Italian wheat. Specialty ingredients include hazelnut flour, pomegranates, Italian chestnut honey, Delaware wildflower honey and clover honey. A handful of whole-flower hops are added, but the bulk of the bitterness comes from gentian root and the sarsaparilla-like Ethiopian myrrh resin.\r\n \r\nBirra del Borgo and Baladin also will brew a version of Birra Etrusca, and to add complexity and variety, each brewery will ferment its batches with different traditional materials. Dogfish will use bronze, Baladin will use wood, and Birra del Borgo will use terra cotta.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Birra Etrusca Bronze", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ffEc4d/upload_dEKZHU-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ffEc4d/upload_dEKZHU-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/ffEc4d/upload_dEKZHU-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.
