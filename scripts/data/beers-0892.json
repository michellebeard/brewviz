Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.

have earned worldwide critical acclaim \u2013 Rogue Creamery and Rogue Ales & Spirits \u2013 will debut Anniversary Ale at SAVOR, a unique American craft beer & food tasting experience, on June 3rd in Washington, DC. The beer celebrates the Rogue Creamery\u2019s 75th Anniversary (1935-2010) and will be paired at SAVOR with Rogue Farms Freedom Cheddar cheese, a cow\u2019s milk cheddar cheese hand-mixed with Freedom hops from the Chatoe Rogue Micro Hopyard in Oregon\u2019s Wigrich Appellation. Whole hop leaves are de-stemmed by hand, steeped in hot water, mixed into the curds and eventually pressed into blocks. The Rogue Creamery, an artisan cheese company, with people dedicated to service, sustainability and the art and tradition of making the world\u2019s finest handmade cheese, has received over 70 awards for taste and quality, including multiple 1st Place Medals for their Echo Mountain, Rogue River, and Oregon Blue Cheeses at both National & International cheese competitions. It is not the first time the two Rogues have collaborated \u2013 Morimoto Soba Ale Cheddar and Chocolate Stout Cheddar cheeses are available at the Rogue Creamery Cheese Shop and online store, all Rogue Ales Public Houses, as well as select gourmet retailers nationwide. Anniversary Ale was designed by Rogue Creamery owner Dave Gremmels and Rogue Ales Brewmaster John Maier to pair perfectly with the unique terroir of the Rogue-grown hops used to make the Rogue Farms Cheddar & TouVelle cheeses. It is brewed using 10 ingredients: Crystal 75, Weyermann Carafe Special II, Malteries Franco Belges Kiln Amber, Hugh Baird Brown and Rogue Micro Barley Farm DareTM & RiskTM Malts; Rogue Micro Hopyard Rebel Hops; Buckwheat, Free Range Coastal Water & Pacman Yeast. Rogue Ales is honored to be part of the American Artisan Cheese Renaissance. The Growers, Farmers, Maltsters, Millers, Mashers, Brewers, Fermenters, Distillers, Smithers, Ocean-Agers and Smokers of the Rogue Nation Department of Agriculture remain dedicated to saving the terroir of Oregon hops and barley one acre at a time by growing their own.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Rogue Creamery 75th Anniversary Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/oge72o/upload_UVqDln-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/oge72o/upload_UVqDln-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/oge72o/upload_UVqDln-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.
