The flavor is very roasted, coffee, sweet and a hint of coconut. It goes down warm due to the higher alcohol volume. We serve our Russian Stout in a brandy snifter to let is slowly warm up to release its entire flavor.

Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character.
