Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house.

Their love of beer began in the 90\u2019s, which eventually lead to homebrewing, and an endless pursuit of finding the best craft beers the World had to offer.\r\n\r\nThey chose the name \"Chandeleur\" in honor of one of their favorite places, the Chandeleur Islands off the coast of Mississippi. The uninhabited island chain is approximately 50 miles long and is home to some of the best redfish and speckled trout fishing on the planet.\r\n\r\nCam and Cain were born and raised in Gulfport, MS. Being raised on the coast instilled in them a true love for the water. When they\u2019re not brewing beer, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to find them fishing or cruising in a boat with family.\r\n\r\nAs they gained a real passion for craft beer and continued to hone their homebrewing skills, they began to dream about opening their own microbrewery. Several years later, in July of 2012, Senate Bill 2878 became law, raising the permissible alcohol content in Mississippi beer from 5% by weight (6.25%ABV) to 8% by weight (10.1% ABV). The fellas knew that it was high time to start making their dream into a reality. And, they knew that Mississippi was the place to do it.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2013, they purchased a historic building in downtown Gulfport and broke ground for what is now Chandeleur Brewing Company.

You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2/3\u2019s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer.
