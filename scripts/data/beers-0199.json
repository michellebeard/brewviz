Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL.

For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston.

Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to \"550 degrees\"? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That\u2019s what craft beer is\u2026a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well\u2026..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.\r\n\r\nOnce NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik\u2019s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park\u2019s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers.

However, the endeavor was well worth it as Brown\u2019s Brewing Company became an instant success as the first brewery restaurant in the Capital Region.\r\n\r\nToday, our River Street Taproom in Troy, New York is a social hub for the community and offers a menu that compliments the beer we brew on site. We brew over 25 different styles of ales and lagers throughout the year and serve over a dozen beers on tap at any one time. Our dependable ales and lagers are also available in bottles at home or on draft in select taverns and restaurants throughout the Capital Region.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "wadu38", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Troy", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "streetAddress": "417-419 River Street", "postalCode": "12180", "website": "http://www.brownsbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1993", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "518-273-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.735771, "locationType": "micro", "region": "New York", "longitude": -73.687704, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brown's", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:05:37", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HnWya6/upload_Vv7NlC-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HnWya6/upload_Vv7NlC-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HnWya6/upload_Vv7NlC-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HnWya6/upload_Vv7NlC-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HnWya6/upload_Vv7NlC-icon.png"}, "id": "HnWya6", "name": "Brown's Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "description": "American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients. There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 3, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:28:32", "shortName": "Sour", "id": 40, "name": "American-Style Sour Ale"}, "createDate": "2016-05-28 00:28:16", "updateDate": "2016-06-08 17:38:50", "abv": "5", "styleId": 40, "id": "XxbYX5", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "Y", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.amicassalida.com/", "established": "2002", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Amicas\u2019 award winning brewery produces a wide spectrum of ales and lagers to accompany your meal.
