Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-05-10 18:56:21", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "oN5ry0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bangor", "createDate": "2013-05-10 19:02:53", "streetAddress": "570 Main Street", "postalCode": "04401", "website": "http://www.geaghanspub.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "207-945-3730", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.786998, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Maine", "longitude": -68.777343, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Geaghan Brothers", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:42:57", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-icon.png"}, "id": "jmyqSv", "name": "Geaghan Brothers Brewing"}], "originalGravity": "1.083", "id": "4mSTHF", "createDate": "2015-04-22 16:29:56", "updateDate": "2015-04-22 16:29:57", "abv": "9.3", "styleId": 31, "foodPairings": "Boneless Wings, Spicy foods, Steak", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.075", "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

After staggering debt was paid off thanks to community support, it was time to give Rondy back to the people. Time to bring it back to its Alaskan roots and reengage the vast majority of the community that had walked away from it.\r\n\r\nBob & Mark brought up the idea for an event so out there, so uniquely Alaskan that it was destined for success. All it needed was someone (enter Susan Duck, Rondy's Executive Director) to round up some reindeer, a little planning and insurance... insurance that took nine months to find. Finally, the last company on the list, agreed to insure the event.\r\nAt that moment, the legendary Rondy Running of the Reindeer was born. Born of a trinity of minds just twisted enough to see the potential joy it could bring to all on hand. Bob & Mark added in the United States Marine Corps Toys for Tots as their benficiary and to date we have raised over $30,000 for them.\r\n\r\nSusan added in the costume element when she relayed to the registrants a challenge from one \"Margy J.\", who \"challenged everyone to show the world how Alaskans Run with the Reindeer - boas, sequins, etc.\".

Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open.

They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the \u2018Port Melbourne Brewing Co\u2019 operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.\r\n \r\nIn 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family \u2013 an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.\r\n \r\nIn 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant \u2013 so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.\r\n \r\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve produced some of Australia\u2019s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards.
