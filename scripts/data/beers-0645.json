We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "mailingListUrl": "http://burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Berlin", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "id": "dB9k9t", "streetAddress": "10016 Old Ocean City Blvd", "postalCode": "21811", "website": "http://www.burleyoak.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "410-422-8887", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.3338561, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Maryland", "longitude": -75.2169099, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Burley Oak Craft", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:17:12", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_jI9hqa-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png"}, "id": "rKXfsB", "name": "Burley Oak Craft Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Our philosophy starts with the raw materials we use, water from The Yorkshire Dales, the finest English malted barley and hops, sourced by our brewer from all over the world. We let those simple ingredients speak for themselves and combine them with skill and patience to brew beers that are balanced, exceptional and just", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-04-15 00:47:11", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "fpVo3M", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ilkley", "createDate": "2013-04-15 00:48:11", "streetAddress": "40 Ashlands Road", "postalCode": "LS29 8JT", "website": "http://www.ilkleybrewery.co.uk/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "phone": "+44 1943 604604", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 53.9296698, "locationType": "micro", "region": "West Yorkshire", "longitude": -1.8130207, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "The Ilkley Brewery Co.", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:42:09", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p4GtgL/upload_F3opaQ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p4GtgL/upload_F3opaQ-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p4GtgL/upload_F3opaQ-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p4GtgL/upload_F3opaQ-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p4GtgL/upload_F3opaQ-icon.png"}, "id": "p4GtgL", "name": "The Ilkley Brewery Co."}], "name": "Lotus IPA", "nameDisplay": "Lotus IPA", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/RuPkog/upload_Su5mpB-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/RuPkog/upload_Su5mpB-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/RuPkog/upload_Su5mpB-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

A 258% increase in one year (lookout Bud!).", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:00", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "fHseLN", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Arena", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:00", "streetAddress": "7556 Pine Road", "postalCode": "53503", "website": "http://www.lakelouie.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "608-753-2675", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 43.1706377, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wisconsin", "longitude": -89.9323658, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Lake Louie", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:50:15", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PfbcZa/upload_pcPinz-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PfbcZa/upload_pcPinz-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PfbcZa/upload_pcPinz-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PfbcZa/upload_pcPinz-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PfbcZa/upload_pcPinz-icon.png"}, "id": "PfbcZa", "name": "Lake Louie Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.072", "description": "Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied.
