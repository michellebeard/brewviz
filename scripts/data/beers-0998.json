In fact we\u2019ve had it figured out for years.  We both had our hearts set on brewing the sort of beer we loved so much in Yorkshire.\r\nMany people know that Martha and I love Theakston\u2019s Old Peculier, at least the cask version.  But Robinson\u2019s Old Tom is high on our list as well.  Now that Samuel Smith has released Yorkshire Stingo that makes three.  At the brewery where I worked in Yorkshire we made a unique beer called \u201cMorocco Ale\u201d  that is quite similar as well.\r\n\r\nObviously PRETTY THINGS isn\u2019t all about simple replication.  As a rule we don\u2019t do beer \u201cstyles\u201d straight up, as it doesn\u2019t leave any room for creativity.  Instead we take our inspiration from great beers as a starting point.\r\n\r\n\u201cRustic Dark Ale\u201d, is about as apt a descriptor as we could come up with for Saint Botolph\u2019s Town (we almost used \u201cNew World Stingo\u201d but decided to save that for a future beer).  This ale is formulated with the malts of Thomas Fawcett & Sons of Yorkshire, England as its base.  When I was brewing in Yorkshire I visited this magnificent maltings many times, seeing crystal and roasted malts still made by hand. On brew day their crystal malt gave an amazing golden raisin-like aroma in the kettle.  Fantastic!\r\n\r\nAs we did in Jack D\u2019Or, we used a small amount of Malted Oats, but cut it this time with Torrefied Wheat.  We \u201cchaptalized\u201d using four different types of sugar in very small doses for both flavour AND colour.\r\n\r\nSBT is fermented with two yeast strains for a unique rustic finish.  But it\u2019s in the yeast strains where this beer really departs from the typical: one is a German ale strain, the other is a common English strain.  Why?  Because it\u2019s about the flavour, not just ticking the \u201cstyle\u201d boxes.\r\n\r\nIn the end we have an ale of 5.9% abv with a big malty, almost smokey Black Malt character, a bitter attack from Fuggle hops, a rich barleymalt finish, some dried coconut hints and an old ale acidity around the edges.  We\u2019ve even timed its tan head, standing proud for ten minutes!\r\n\r\nThe name \u201cSaint Botolph\u2019s Town\u201d is in tribute to our great home in America: Boston.  The original Boston in Lincolnshire, England is an abbreviation of \u201cBotolph\u2019s Town\u201d or \u201cBotolph\u2019s Stone\u201d. When we were back in Yorkshire recently, we found a churchyard where St. Botolph spoke in the year 675; a \u2018stump\u2019 (broken old cross) marks the spot.

Our most decorated beer and now the most decorated brown porter in the history of the Great American Beer Festival! \r\n\r\nPorter was wildly popular back in the 1700s in England and was considered the \u201cworking man\u2019s beer\u201d. At one point porter accounted for 80% of the beer sold in England. Everybody brewed a porter. When Arthur Guinness was running his brewery, he was brewing porter.\r\nMedals:\r\n2013 Silver medal \u2013 Great American Beer Festival \r\n2010 Silver medal \u2013 Great American Beer Festival\r\n2009 Gold medal \u2013 Great American Beer Festival\r\n2008 Bronze medal - World Beer Cup\r\n2007 Bronze medal - Great American Beer Festival\r\n2006 Silver medal - Great American Beer Festival\r\n2004 Silver medal - Great American Beer Festival\r\n1999 Bronze medal - Great American Beer Festival\r\n1996 Bronze medal - Great American Beer Festival\r\n1996 Gold medal - World Beer Cup\r\n\r\nTasting notes:\r\nAppearance: Deep garnet red color with creamy tan head\r\nAroma: Hints of dark chocolate, roasted malt and burnt toffee  \r\nTaste: Roasted malt with notes of bittersweet chocolate, raisins and smoky coffee-like character.\r\nMouth feel: Medium-full\r\nFinish: Smooth and well balance.\r\nOverall: This beer is chock full of complex flavors yet is round and well balanced. The late beer author, Michael Jackson says of St. Charles Porter, \u201c\u2026 has a firm body and offers the sensation of biting into a praline filled with cream. The richness rounds into bitter chocolate. The beer is smooth, sociable, and dry enough in the finish to demand another round.\u201d", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
