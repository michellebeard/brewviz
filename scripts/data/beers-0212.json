Since taking over this mid-town establishment, the Pajaks added a beer & wine license and subsequently transformed the European-style cafe into a beer-centric place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner and all beers during, around and between these fabulous meals. \r\n\r\nThe cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always right\u009d temperature, glass, presentation. \r\n\r\nNo hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.\r\n\r\nGruit is an old style one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. Cafe Amsterdam's Gruit is dark, strong and interesting. This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down! Thoroughly enjoy this old-world beer now but stash some away for later dwelvings. \r\n\r\nAvailability: \r\nAK - 22-oz bottles (limited release begins 05/29/2009)", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Cafe Amsterdam's 10th Anniversary Gruit", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.midnightsunbrewing.com/", "established": "1994", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Since firing up its brew kettle in 1995, Midnight Sun Brewing Company has become a serious yet creative force on the American brewing front.

With over 85 breweries in San Diego in January of 2013, we knew that we wanted to add our own unique contribution to the beer scene. Having been raised on both sides of the border, we always enjoyed eating from both cultures.  Mexican Street Tacos, chile enfused candies, enchiladas one day, and Hamburgers, mac and cheese and ding dongs the next. As adults we realized how unique being raised on the border was, how the mix of flavors was seeping from north to south, and south to north. It was this fusion in flavors that inspired to take traditional, European brewing traditions and infuse the process with a whole new palette of Latin American ingredients.  So we dug into our own roots for inspiration and found a treasure trove of brewing traditions, ingredients and unique flavors.

Neuse River Brewing Co. incorporates sustainable practices and buys local whenever possible in an effort to support our neighbors.\r\n\r\nNRBC will be located just outside the Five Points area in Raleigh, North Carolina. The 68 year old building, originally built for restoring and building firetrucks, will house the 20bbl brewhouse and tasting room. Come early 2015, patrons will be able to enjoy one of our Belgian inspired ales while taking in a view of the downtown Raleigh city skyline or relaxing beside the herb garden.\r\n\r\nNRBC provides a gathering place for friends, family and community to share stories and quality time with one another. And, if we\u2019re lucky, our beers will help to inspire new stories and memories for many years to come.\r\n \r\nSant\u00e9!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-03-06 13:35:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "ziZrmT", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Raleigh", "createDate": "2014-03-06 13:35:50", "streetAddress": "518 Pershing Rd.", "postalCode": "27608", "website": "http://neuseriverbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(404) 386-752", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.8041774, "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -78.6328332, "updateDate": "2015-08-24 17:31:09", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Neuse River", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:52:07", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ym0fEg/upload_XDDBud-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ym0fEg/upload_XDDBud-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ym0fEg/upload_XDDBud-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ym0fEg/upload_XDDBud-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ym0fEg/upload_XDDBud-icon.png"}, "id": "Ym0fEg", "name": "Neuse River Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.075", "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
