The first kegs of Old Capital, Hurricane Kitty and Mother\u2019s Milk went to competition at Hunter Mountain that month. Mother\u2019s Milk took home a gold medal and Old Capital was honored with People\u2019s Choice: Best of Show.\r\n\r\nAfter getting the brewery up and running selling draft beer, the crew at Keegan Ales turned their attention to the defunct bottling line.

His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer.  Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby.\r\nJosh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons.   \r\nFast-forward a few years.  Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since).  Even more years went by.  Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer.  Yes, beer.  At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers.  It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers.  Goodridge was hooked.  \r\n\r\nMany weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast.  The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day.  That always loosened the tongue.  Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level.  \r\n\r\nGoodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember.  On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea.  Enough was enough, he told her.  He immediately called Stacy and said, \"I'm coming over to your house.\"  Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth.  \"Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job.\" \r\n\r\nJosh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen.  Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla.  Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous. \r\n\r\nOne week later, all the beer they had made was gone.  It was\r\na hit!  The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map.  Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri.  You are invited to come in and have a pint with us.  Cheers!\r\n \r\nNow that you know our story, we encourage you to come in and share yours. No matter what the occasion, visiting The Public House Brewery is always an extraordinary experience.  \r\n \r\nThe team at Public House looks forward to welcoming you!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "e0v4NA", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Rolla", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "streetAddress": "600 North Rolla Street", "postalCode": "65401", "extendedAddress": "Suite B", "website": "http://www.publichousebrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2010", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "573-426-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Rolla Brewpub", "latitude": 37.9489305, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Missouri", "longitude": -91.7721244, "updateDate": "2016-09-20 15:44:16", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun:  11:00am - 7:00pm\nMon:  11:00am - 7:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 7:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 11:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "St. James", "createDate": "2016-06-27 16:11:23", "id": "Dch3p7", "streetAddress": "551 State Route B", "postalCode": "65559", "website": "http://www.publichousebrewery.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2014", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "573-261-3333", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Public House Brewing Company", "latitude": 38.009672, "locationType": "production", "region": "Missouri", "longitude": -91.6072769, "updateDate": "2016-09-20 15:05:47", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Public House", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-27 18:23:10", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BumlJd/upload_BVZXT3-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BumlJd/upload_BVZXT3-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BumlJd/upload_BVZXT3-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BumlJd/upload_BVZXT3-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BumlJd/upload_BVZXT3-icon.png"}, "id": "BumlJd", "name": "Public House Brewing Company"}], "description": "The ultimate session beer.
