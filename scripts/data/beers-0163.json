At Uinta, we have replicated a true old world pilsner by using the finest imported Saaz hops and then aging this golden lager for nearly a month. The aging process creates a smooth, mellow flavor that gives it a remarkable drinkability. Enjoy the delicate balance between the flowery hops and the assertive malt flavors.\r\n\r\nWhere did the name come from? Uinta embraced the concept of renewable energy in 2001 by committing to 100% wind powered energy. The name Blue Sky Pilsner stems from that commitment.\r\n\r\nTASTING NOTES:\r\nMalty taste and generously hopped. Citrus highlights. Finishes crisp and dry.
