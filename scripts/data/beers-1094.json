Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:44:12", "shortName": "Rye Ale", "id": 117, "name": "Rye Ale or Lager with or without Yeast"}, "id": "5vm2ZK", "createDate": "2015-09-22 16:51:59", "updateDate": "2015-12-18 05:18:46", "abv": "5.8", "styleId": 117, "availableId": 2, "ibu": "85", "name": "Turn a Blind Rye"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Oktoberfest brewed with smoked malts, fennel seed, and other herbs and spices.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Turn For The Wurst", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 8, "name": "North American Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.05", "description": "The American style of these classic German beers is distinguished by a comparatively greater degree of hop character. In general the style is characterized by a medium body and broad range of color from golden to reddish brown. Sweet maltiness should dominate over clean hop bitterness. The bitterness should not be aggressive or harsh. Malt character should be light-toasted rather than strongly caramel (though a low level of light caramel character is acceptable).
