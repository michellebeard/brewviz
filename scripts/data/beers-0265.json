Chili Beers are any beers using chili peppers as a flavor, aroma or \u201cheat\u201d inducing adjunct to create distinct and balanced (ranging from subtle to intense) character. Chili pepper aromas ranging from subtle to intense may or may not be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Malt sweetness can vary from very low to medium-high levels, depending on the underlying beer style. Hop bitterness is very low to medium-high. Chili pepper aroma and flavor qualities should not be overpowered by hop aroma and flavor, and should be present in harmony with characteristics typical of the underlying beer style. Chili pepper qualities may vary widely as vegetal, spicy or \"heat\" inducing flavors and/or aromas.", "createDate": "2015-04-07 17:17:16", "categoryId": 11, "shortName": "Chili Beer", "id": 168, "name": "Chili Pepper Beer"}, "id": "TF9lkj", "createDate": "2015-06-26 16:35:57", "updateDate": "2015-12-18 03:18:07", "abv": "6.9", "styleId": 168, "ibu": "31", "name": "Controlled Burn"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Loaded with hops like an IPA, yet drinks like a Pale Ale, we simply decided to call it a Strong Pale Ale.
