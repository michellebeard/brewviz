But until a few years ago, no one told us about all the great Australian craft brewing happening, much of it done by our friends at Mountain Goat Beer.

So, Brooklyn brewer Al Duvall and lab manager Tom Price went down to Australia to visit Mountain Goat and collaboratively brew the cross-breed named Hopfweizenbock.\r\n\r\nNow it\u2019s the Goat Crew\u2019s turn for the 24-hour airplane trips to Brooklyn, as we bring you Ridgy-Didge, a strong saison with a distinctly Australian edge. We start the party with malt and a little candy sugar, and then rev it up with two native Australian flavors\u2014startlingly aromatic lemon myrtle leaves, and kicky Tasmanian pepperberries. After fermentation by our house Belgian yeast, the final touch is a light dry-hopping with the Australian hop variety Super Pride of Ringwood. The tasty result is a honey-colored beer with a lean, dry, hoppy palate and a bright, refreshingly lemony finish. This beer is a superstar at the summer dinner table, especially with grilled chicken, shrimp, salmon, and burgers.\r\n\r\nRidgy-Didge? Lemon myrtle? Tasmanian pepperberry? Super Pride of Ringwood?

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.

We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival.

During the start up process, Nathan took a job as an assistant brewer at Grizzly Peak, leaving after 18 months to focus efforts on Bitter Old Fecker exclusively. \r\n\r\nNathan and Cecil produce high gravity, bold beers brewed in a \"rustic\" style. No automatic equipment. Kettles, mash tuns, etc., stirred by hand in a brewery that can literally produce beer without the use of electricity. All beers are barrel-aged and include non traditional, foraged and locally sourced ingredients. All malt and hops are 100% US grown.

This year\u2019s Un-human Cannonball, a continuation of their Cannonball IPAs, was something to behold.  Last year they sent down their hallucinogenic six-shooter of a festival bar to LCBF 13, head brewer Stuart painted his beard blue and red and they served up an amazing array of beers, including Beer World Cup winner, Salty Kiss.  This year, expect Yorkshire\u2019s finest to craft flavour and fun into some of the best beer you\u2019ll try this summer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-12-13 23:56:41", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "GB", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Huddersfield HD3", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "createDate": "2015-01-20 19:57:52", "longitude": -1.8280275, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 53.6533435, "streetAddress": "Quarmby Mills Tanyard Road", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-01-20 19:58:09", "country": {"displayName": "United Kingdom", "name": "UNITED KINGDOM", "isoThree": "GBR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 826, "isoCode": "GB"}, "postalCode": "4YP", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "82Ynoe", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Magic Rock", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:02:20", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8QPpzE/upload_LzTASA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8QPpzE/upload_LzTASA-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8QPpzE/upload_LzTASA-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8QPpzE/upload_LzTASA-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8QPpzE/upload_LzTASA-icon.png"}, "id": "8QPpzE", "name": "Magic Rock Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
