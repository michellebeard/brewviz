Consisting of a larger than life grain bill that starts with our base malt and roasted barley, we pack our mash tun full of an immense amount of crushed grains. Once the mash has completed we draw off a portion of the wort and begin a kettle caramelization process turning thisdark liquid into a syrup-like consistency to bring out the full, rich flavors of the malt. Once this process has been completed we add this syrup into the boil with the rest of wort and continue on with an intensely long boil to further concentrate the fermentable sugars. After a lengthy fermentation process, Marauder emerges with an alcohol content that will slay the masses. If that wasn't enough, this beer escaped into hibernation inside oak barrels for 3 months where it soaked up the bourbon character of the oak. With one taste, Marauder will snare your senses with the full malt flavor, bourbon notes, and caramel sweetness.
