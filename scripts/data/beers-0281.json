One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe.\r\n\r\nDon and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY.\r\n\r\nEvery patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.\r\n\r\nSo.

Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DF5YsC", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "streetAddress": "30 Germania Street", "postalCode": "02130", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-372-1131", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.314449, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.103365, "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "MLUbXI", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2013-08-12 13:10:57", "streetAddress": "1625 Central Parkway", "postalCode": "45214", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-412-3200", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Cincinnati", "latitude": 39.1144986, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5222061, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Production Brewery", "locality": "Breinigsville", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.6290377, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 40.5759622, "streetAddress": "7880 Penn Drive", "createDate": "2015-11-30 20:24:56", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2007", "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "postalCode": "18031", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "XZ6L8a", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Boston Beer", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:24:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png"}, "id": "1wSztN", "name": "Boston Beer Company"}], "description": "This crisp pale ale is named after Crystal hops grown in Oregon, which give the beer its distinctive American hop character.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.
