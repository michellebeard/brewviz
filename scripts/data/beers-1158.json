A caramel and/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably.

We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival. We\u2019re now seven days a week for brewery tours and tastings, and we have full roster of weekly events.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "5tw2Iw", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Los Angeles", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "streetAddress": "216 S Alameda St", "postalCode": "90013", "website": "http://www.angelcitybrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "310-329-8881", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 34.0466054, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -118.2378181, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Angel City", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:15:22", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_q87thj-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_q87thj-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_q87thj-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_q87thj-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_q87thj-icon.png"}, "id": "0ZIlVA", "name": "Angel City Brewing"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery\u2019s demise.\r\nBig Muddy Brewing\u2019s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago\u2019s Rosati\u2019s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.\r\nIt was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.\r\nStuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.\r\nStuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.\r\nThe first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg\u2019s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good \u201ccraft beer transition brew\u201d for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).\r\nKinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s second selection, \u201cSaluki Dunkel Dog\u201d, a dark, amber/dunkel style beer.\r\nThe third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s lineup is an ale called \u201cBig Muddy Pale Ale\u201d, and future varieties include \u201cLogan\u2019s Lager\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Murphysboro", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "id": "QkdgSV", "streetAddress": "1430 North 7th Street", "postalCode": "62966", "website": "http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(618) 684-8833", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 37.7823381, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -89.3321145, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Big Muddy", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:18:15", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_W7yNNA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_W7yNNA-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_W7yNNA-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_W7yNNA-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_W7yNNA-icon.png"}, "id": "oBe8dQ", "name": "Big Muddy Brewing Co"}], "name": "Winter Ale", "nameDisplay": "Winter Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BnbFhb/upload_0iFFzu-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BnbFhb/upload_0iFFzu-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/BnbFhb/upload_0iFFzu-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable.
