A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems. New World is now Premier Stainless and Rob and Alan are two of the best in the business.\r\n\r\nWe have three 20 bbl fermenters and one 20 bbl bright tank.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Taproom Hours\r\nWednesday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nThursday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nFriday: 3pm - 8pm\r\nSaturday: 1pm - 4pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Birmingham", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "id": "pj4HJk", "streetAddress": "114 14th Street South", "latitude": 33.50713, "website": "http://www.goodpeoplebrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2007", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "35223", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alabama", "longitude": -86.811894, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Good People", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:13:08", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fib7Lb/upload_VODxsX-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fib7Lb/upload_VODxsX-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fib7Lb/upload_VODxsX-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fib7Lb/upload_VODxsX-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fib7Lb/upload_VODxsX-icon.png"}, "id": "fib7Lb", "name": "Good People Brewing Company"}], "id": "W5jSKN", "createDate": "2012-01-23 13:45:12", "updateDate": "2015-04-24 13:31:15", "abv": "5.2", "ibu": "34", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Federbrau Beer", "nameDisplay": "Federbrau Beer", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.thaibev.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Cosmos Brewery", "createDate": "2013-05-02 23:01:59", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.thaibev.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 13.8361545, "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Bangkok", "countryIsoCode": "TH", "longitude": 100.5633676, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "0-2617-9500-29", "streetAddress": "15 Vibhavadee Rangsit Road", "createDate": "2013-05-03 00:45:46", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Thailand", "name": "THAILAND", "isoThree": "THA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 764, "isoCode": "TH"}, "postalCode": "10900", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "MQ1eA7", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Cosmos", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:42:29", "id": "Vemjn6", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "createDate": "2013-05-03 00:48:55", "updateDate": "2013-05-03 00:48:55", "abv": "4.7", "id": "JnY9uG", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Federico II", "nameDisplay": "Federico II", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.birraflea.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "In accordance with the best quality standards, Birra Flea uses a very pure water and a high quality malt. malts used in the brewing process are obtained from 100% italian barleys, grown in our own lands, in order to guarantee a short distribution chain. we don\u2019t use unmalted grains. our beers are both unfiltered and unpasteurized, and refermented in the bottle in order to preserve their original organoleptic properties, without the addition of chemical additives.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-08-27 03:11:15", "nameShortDisplay": "Birra Flea", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:15:25", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/aHHPN7/upload_EKPisp-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/aHHPN7/upload_EKPisp-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/aHHPN7/upload_EKPisp-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/aHHPN7/upload_EKPisp-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/aHHPN7/upload_EKPisp-icon.png"}, "id": "aHHPN7", "name": "Birra Flea"}], "originalGravity": "1.059", "createDate": "2015-08-27 16:38:12", "updateDate": "2015-08-27 16:38:12", "abv": "5.9", "styleId": 2, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.05", "description": "Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo .

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo .

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:56", "shortName": "BBL Aged Sour", "id": 136, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer"}, "createDate": "2014-08-28 03:02:56", "updateDate": "2014-09-05 18:32:20", "abv": "6", "styleId": 136, "id": "0GPzKt", "name": "Felix - Love with Virginia Peaches"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.woodstockinnbrewery.com/", "established": "1995", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The Woodstock Inn opened in 1982.\r\n\r\nThe Woodstock Inn Brewery began brewing beer in 1995 on a 7 barrel system.
