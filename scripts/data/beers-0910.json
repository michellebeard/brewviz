We were born on February 26, 1971 when our founders took their entrepreneurial spirit and experiences they received making pizza and serving beer at Shakey\u2019s Pizza Parlor to open their own restaurant. That first restaurant was called the Ram Pub, which was a \u201cDeluxe Tavern\u201d that served hot food, including cook-your-own burgers and steaks, along with beer and wine.\r\n\r\nSince 1971, the Ram\u2019s primary commitment has been to always provide our guests with superior quality food and gracious hospitality. Although Big Horn Brewing Company is now one of the largest brewpub companies in the country, the goal of our brewers continues to be to produce the freshest, most \u201cdrinkable\u201d beer of the highest quality.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "yearClosed": "2013", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "Qg6dpg", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cheyenne", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "streetAddress": "1650 Dell Range Boulevard", "postalCode": "82001", "website": "http://www.cbpotts.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1971", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "307-632-8636", "isClosed": "Y", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.160727, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Wyoming", "longitude": -104.801787, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday -

From Jason\u2019s wedding to his son\u2019s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile.
