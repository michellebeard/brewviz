This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:56", "shortName": "BBL Aged Sour", "id": 136, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beer"}, "createDate": "2013-04-15 01:00:58", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 00:49:31", "abv": "5.6", "styleId": 136, "id": "3uoZQM", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.rocketrepublicbrewing.com/", "established": "2013", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "We are located in Madison, Alabama!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-06-08 13:24:11", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "mY1LX6", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "Y", "locality": "Madison", "createDate": "2013-06-08 13:24:40", "streetAddress": "500 Lanier Road", "postalCode": "35758", "website": "http://www.rocketrepublicbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(256) 555-1212", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 34.6858945, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alabama", "longitude": -86.7382118, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Rocket Republic", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-23 18:48:23", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hxuK21/upload_kdJyYc-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hxuK21/upload_kdJyYc-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hxuK21/upload_kdJyYc-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hxuK21/upload_kdJyYc-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hxuK21/upload_kdJyYc-icon.png"}, "id": "hxuK21", "name": "Rocket Republic Brewing Company"}], "description": "Astronut Brown Ale- For those of us who gravitate toward the nuttier side, this English Style Brown Ale is for us.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.", "createDate": "2015-04-07 17:10:42", "categoryId": 1, "shortName": "Contemporary Gose", "id": 165, "name": "Contemporary Gose"}, "createDate": "2015-12-15 19:15:41", "updateDate": "2015-12-15 19:15:41", "abv": "4.5", "styleId": 165, "id": "VQdy65", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.reformationbrewery.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Reformation Brewery", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "OsDwRF", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Ball Ground", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:06", "streetAddress": "750 Henry Turner Trail", "postalCode": "30107", "website": "http://www.reformationbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "678-341-0828", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 34.353257, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Georgia", "longitude": -84.47638, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Reformation", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:25:23", "id": "E3BHII", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "name": "Atlas", "ingredients": {"hops": [{"myrceneMax": 60, "farneseneMax": 6, "cohumuloneMax": 40, "id": 22, "humuleneMax": 13, "category": "hop", "createDate": "2013-06-24 16:07:28", "farneseneMin": 6, "humuleneMin": 13, "betaAcidMax": 7, "cohumuloneMin": 33, "myrceneMin": 45, "alphaAcidMin": 5.5, "description": "Cascade was created in the United States as an open-pollinated cross between Fuggle and Serebrianker.

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
