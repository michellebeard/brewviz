Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

Earth Day, April 22nd, is the chance for everyone to make personal commitments to sustainability that lead to a larger, collective action. Eel River Brewing wants to show their commitment to sustainability and encourage others to do so by producing a sustainable, organic beer that promotes Earth Day and supports a like-minded non-profit.\r\n\r\nEarth Thirst, a Double IPA, will be brewed with over 3 pounds of hops per barrel throughout the brewing process, giving it a fresh and intense aroma. When it comes to Double IPAs, Head Brewer Mike Smith says that \u201cit\u2019s all about hop flavor and aroma from the dry hops. The flavor depends on the hops that you use. Since this beer uses Cascade and Centennial hops, it has a heavy floral aroma and citrus flavor.\u201d What makes this Double IPA unique is that it uses the highest quality, all organic ingredients - all from the Pacific Northwest. According to Smith, \u201cThe more locally produced ingredients are the more fresh they are when we get them, allowing the flavors to come out more.\u201d Earth Thirst is not only 100% organic, but 100% sustainable also as Eel River Brewing is 100% bio-mass powered. Eel River Brewing will begin shipping out their Earth Thirst beer at the end of March with only limited quantities available since Earth Thirst is a specialty release. To help promote organics and sustainability, a portion of the proceeds of Earth Thirst will be donated to CCOF.\r\n\r\nEel River Brewing chose to work with CCOF due to their practices and beliefs. CCOF is the only full-service organic certification agency and trade association that provides benefits on behalf of it members. CCOF certifies over 2,400 clients in the US, Mexico and Canada and its members and clients receive full trade association benefits, which include advocacy, education, marketing support and networking opportunities for the organic community (CCOF.org). Robin Boyle, Director of Marketing, Member Services and Development for CCOF, described the importance of CCOF and Eel River Brewing working together: \u201cWe are very excited to celebrate Earth Day with the first certified organic brewery. It\u2019s a fun campaign, and a reminder to us all to consider where our food comes from and how we can positively impact the environment by choosing organic.\u201d\r\n\r\nEel River Brewing Company is the first certified organic brewery in the United States. They produce seven year-round styles of beer as well as seasonal beers. Not only does Eel River Brewing have a commitment to handcrafted, traditional, organic craft beer, but they also believe in sustainable practices. The brewing facility is a reclaimed redwood lumber mill and is powered by 100% renewable energy, using bio-mass power.
