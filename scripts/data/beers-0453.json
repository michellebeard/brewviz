Adventures in biking, canoeing, and hiking that led the trio to the northern New England states allowed them to visit some of the first operating craft breweries. Armed with a we can do this attitude the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to found the Wachusett Brewing Co. in 1993. Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry. Wachusett Ales continue to be hand crafted with the finest ingredients available, bottled and kegged in our Westminster facility.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey.

Our long term goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds of local workers.\r\n\r\nKeeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries; and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown hops and malt.

We are actively negotiating and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction and website operations with Michigan companies.\r\n\r\nWhere it is not possible to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States.

Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania.

Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:21:11", "fgMax": "1.028", "shortName": "Scotch Ale", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "id": "Q6EwpM", "createDate": "2016-11-16 18:51:25", "updateDate": "2016-11-16 18:51:25", "abv": "7.5", "styleId": 15, "ibu": "26", "name": "Gregarious"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The Gregory shimmers in a strong dark maroon in the glass. \r\nOn the nose of herbs and licorice flavors dominate \r\nwhich are backed by ripe fruit notes. \r\nIn Antrunk a strong Malzk\u00f6rper presented \r\nwhich is dominated by coffee and roasted flavors. \r\nhoney from the region and an Alsatian wine yeast \r\nput a nice sweet and acidity on the palate. \r\nSlightly bitter chocolate flavors accompany the warming finish \r\nthis massive Trappistenbieres.
