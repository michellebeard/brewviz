The date stamped on the cap is a \"Best After\" date approximately three year after the day of production. The yellow cap is the only identifying mark of this beer as there is no label and they use three different bottles in production: plain, \"Trappisten,\" and \"Westmalle.\" The beer is not distributed anywhere in the world. The only way to acquire it is to visit the monastery.\r\n\r\nYoung bottles tend to be rather boozy, yet, the alcohol is never hot or harsh. Dried, dark fruit esters come through in the nose and taste and are accompanied by intense melanoidins.
