The pronounced style originates from Franconia (a region of Southern Germany) dating as early as the Middle Ages. Our hand-crafted Kellerbier is bottom-fermented, traditionally prepared with only pure ingredients and lagered. The fresh direct mountain New York water maintains a perfect amount of minerals to compliment the sweetness of the premium grains and the bitterness from the noble hops. Together you have a well-balanced body of the Kellerbier ready to enjoy; just as those did for centuries since the Medieval Renaissance period. Pull out your Viking hats, Kellerbier is traditionally drunk out of earthenware mugs. The use of eating utensils may be optional with foods. This unfiltered amber lager maintains slightly nutty with hints of caramel, honey and plum flavors. Aromas of apple and citrus combine to give this beer a fruity, zesty freshness.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
