One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe.\r\n\r\nDon and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY.\r\n\r\nEvery patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.\r\n\r\nSo.

When Jim explained that in Oregon, where he came of age, there was a vibrant scene of restaurants and bars that housed their own microbreweries that crafted their own distinct beers that could only be enjoyed at the source, Gantt understandably replied, \"$#@*!\".\r\n\r\nWhat began as a conversation soon became an obsession and, in 1996, the firm Warner and Worth was incorporated to see their shared dream come true.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "VCsRkP", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Columbus", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "streetAddress": "1041 Broadway", "postalCode": "31901", "website": "http://thecannonbrewpub.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1996", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "706-653-2337", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 32.4663533, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Georgia", "longitude": -84.9935198, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "The Cannon Brewpub", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:16:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_4ELzcA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_4ELzcA-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_4ELzcA-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_4ELzcA-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_4ELzcA-icon.png"}, "id": "9vSKac", "name": "The Cannon Brewpub"}], "srm": {"hex": "FFBF42", "id": 4, "name": "4"}, "servingTemperature": "cold", "updateDate": "2013-08-15 10:56:30", "ibu": "18", "createDate": "2013-08-15 02:26:55"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "Y", "name": "Crossroads", "nameDisplay": "Crossroads", "breweries": [{"website": "http://harmonybeer.com/", "established": "2012", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "In 2012 we set out to make small batches of distinct beer for the public without losing the temperamental nature and artisinal approach of home brewing.

Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You\u2019ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d You can almost smell the oil and beer.\r\n\r\nBut more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It\u2019s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.\r\n\r\nFor Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan\u2019s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He\u2019s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary family.)\r\n\r\nSo welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You\u2019re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented. It\u2019s a great deal of work, but hell, that\u2019s what makes a dream worth pursuing.
