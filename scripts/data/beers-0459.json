Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where \u201cthe first sip calls for the third\u201d.  We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

At the age of 13, Mariano emigrated from Italy to Windsor, Ontario, Canada. As a young man, after school Mariano worked at the Studebaker auto factory in order to supplement his preferred vocation of wine making. \r\n \r\nIn 1921 at age 26, Mariano founded Border City Wine Cellars, quickly changing the name to the Meconi Wine Company. Following the repeal of Prohibition in December of 1933, Mariano moved his flourishing wine making enterprise across the river to Detroit in 1934. 1936 was the year Meconi moved the family to its present location in Paw Paw, in order to be closer to the acclaimed Lake Michigan Shore grape-growing region. With the move came a new name, The Italian Wine Company. \r\n \r\nIn 1941, during World War II, Meconi strategically countered rising antifascist sentiment in the United States by switching the name of the company once again, from The Italian Wine Company, to St. Julian Winery. \r\n \r\nIn the last name change of the company, Mariano Meconi humbly paid homage to the patron saint of his native village, Faleria, Italy. All Italian villages have patron saints and San Giuliano, nee St. Julian, stands as the saint that protects the village and the citizens of Faleria. \r\n\r\nWith a rich history, St. Julian still produces some on the long-time favorites, including Sholom Kosher Wine and our award-winning Solera Cream Sherry. Over the past 15 years, St. Julian has focused on producing a new line of single varietal wines. The grapes come from the best vineyards in Southwest Michigan, producing top quality wines.
