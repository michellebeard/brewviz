Hopheads. \r\n\r\nTen years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: \u201cWhy don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?\u201d\r\n\r\nYou could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find.

Following several years of bad harvests, it was ruled that only barley would be used for brewing beer and that rye would be used in baking, only. Rye was reintroduced to brewing in Germany in 1988 producing a grainy beer with a hearty flavor similar to pumpernickel bread. It was dark in color and averaged 5% alc./vol. Many other Red Rye Ales on the market today push the hops to make them rival the IPA s (sometimes referred to as Rye Pas). \r\n\r\nThe Fink Red Rye Ale formula calls for a 20% substitution of rye malt for our usual barley grain blend. Thus, Fink retains that caramel \u201cnose\u201d familiar with other Bad Tom brews, while producing a light, dry beer with a crisp taste and a spicy finish.
