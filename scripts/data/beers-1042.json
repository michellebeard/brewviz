[{"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "This classic ale was brewed with the spirit of Scottish tradition, just like the unique Tartan Scottish plaid that represented one's own clan in the highland country. Using an old technique used before modern malting, we made a mash of all organic British pale malt with a touch of burnt barley. We separated the potent sweet first runnings and caramelized them for hours into a thick sticky syrup while the full size brew boiled away with Nugget hops. Near the end of the boil we combined this dark red caramel syrup back into the main kettle to contribute both its dark color and rich malt flavor. Fermented with a Scottish origin ale yeast for distinctive fruity flavors, this burnt golden strong ale is elegant in its subtlety- easy drinking yet fulfilling, malty yet dry, rich but balanced.\r\n\r\nProduced with time honored tradition, this ale represents Agrarian's respect for the diverse brewing heritage that makes today's beer culture so rich and complex.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Tartan", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.035", "description": "Scottish heavy ale is moderate in strength and dominated by a smooth, sweet maltiness balanced with low, but perceptible, hop bitterness.
