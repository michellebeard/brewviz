There would be much to say and tell it to start back over the key dates. In 1986, Teo decides, with his partner then Michelle, a pretty young French dancer, to open in Piozzo, a small town unknown to the door of the Langhe where he was born, a \"creperie\"! He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery. So begins the adventure productive BEER BALADIN that sees just two beers \"taxes\" to the regulars who frequent the pub goers somewhat perplexed and embarrassed to taste these first, honestly a bit 'adventurous productions Teo. Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world. It is always a place where good food is accompanied not only by our beers but by good music and by the sympathy of the staff who always has a smile for everyone and where it is customary to a friendly \"welcome\", a hello and a good day to all those who pass through it if only for a small beer refreshing.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "IT", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Piozzo", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "longitude": 7.8921316, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "39-0173-795431", "streetAddress": "Piazza V Luglio, 15", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Italy", "name": "ITALY", "isoThree": "ITA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 380, "isoCode": "IT"}, "latitude": 44.5154291, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "1kXTo5", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Birrificia Le Baladin", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:39:56", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6iVXTk/upload_VmI4R2-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6iVXTk/upload_VmI4R2-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6iVXTk/upload_VmI4R2-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6iVXTk/upload_VmI4R2-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/6iVXTk/upload_VmI4R2-icon.png"}, "id": "6iVXTk", "name": "Birrificia Le Baladin"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile.

Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.
