After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:09", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "MfINpl", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Atlanta", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:09", "streetAddress": "195 Ottley Drive", "postalCode": "30324", "website": "http://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "404-691-2537", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.808102, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Georgia", "longitude": -84.38119, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "SweetWater", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-08-23 15:00:55", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_3il9e7-icon.png"}, "id": "TMc6H2", "name": "SweetWater Brewing Company"}], "description": "Perfect for a float down the Hooch or just grillin\u2019 in the backyard, Waterkeeper Hefeweizen is our go to summer brew.

We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California.

The color reflects the choice of fruit. Sourness is an important part of the flavor profile, though sweetness may compromise the intensity. These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and range from a dry to a full-bodied mouthfeel. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.

The Brew House includes a Boil Kettle, Mash Tun and Hot Liquor Tank.

The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels.

Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy.
