This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hefeweizen, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a four-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The room was once the storage area for The Boy Scouts of America Aurora chapter\u2019s canoes and the area gained the nickname \u201cCanoe Room,\u201d which stuck.\r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale).

A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.004", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:34:55", "fgMax": "1.016", "shortName": "Saison", "abvMax": "8.5", "id": 72, "srmMin": "4", "name": "French & Belgian-Style Saison"}, "id": "Opl9br", "createDate": "2016-09-05 11:48:16", "updateDate": "2016-09-16 15:00:37", "abv": "6", "styleId": 72, "srm": {"hex": "FFBF42", "id": 4, "name": "4"}, "ibu": "26", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Keeper IPA", "nameDisplay": "Keeper IPA", "breweries": [{"website": "http://castleislandbeer.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Castle Island Brewing Company", "createDate": "2016-01-09 20:34:04", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Th and Fr 3-8, Sat 12-8", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Norwood", "createDate": "2016-01-09 20:34:05", "id": "sv3UvC", "streetAddress": "32 Astor Ave", "postalCode": "02062", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "781.951.2029", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.1694576, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.1922398, "updateDate": "2016-01-12 17:20:45", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Castle Island", "updateDate": "2016-01-12 17:21:34", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4ur5cM/upload_WjnUTN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4ur5cM/upload_WjnUTN-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4ur5cM/upload_WjnUTN-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4ur5cM/upload_WjnUTN-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4ur5cM/upload_WjnUTN-icon.png"}, "id": "4ur5cM", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
