We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DF5YsC", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "streetAddress": "30 Germania Street", "postalCode": "02130", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-372-1131", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.314449, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.103365, "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "MLUbXI", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Cincinnati", "createDate": "2013-08-12 13:10:57", "streetAddress": "1625 Central Parkway", "postalCode": "45214", "website": "http://www.samueladams.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "513-412-3200", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Cincinnati", "latitude": 39.1144986, "locationType": "production", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -84.5222061, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Production Brewery", "locality": "Breinigsville", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "production", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.6290377, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 40.5759622, "streetAddress": "7880 Penn Drive", "createDate": "2015-11-30 20:24:56", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2007", "updateDate": "2015-12-02 19:22:03", "postalCode": "18031", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "XZ6L8a", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Boston Beer", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:24:45", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/1wSztN/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png"}, "id": "1wSztN", "name": "Boston Beer Company"}], "srm": {"hex": "000000", "id": 41, "name": "Over 40"}, "updateDate": "2015-12-16 14:14:13", "ibu": "60", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:21"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Tasman Reserve Lager is a full bodied and well balanced premium lager that holds the higher alcohol content really well.
