Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:21:11", "fgMax": "1.028", "shortName": "Scotch Ale", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "createDate": "2012-06-10 20:18:59", "updateDate": "2012-06-10 23:15:10", "abv": "8", "styleId": 15, "availableId": 4, "id": "t1UOsF", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The first in our Farmhouse Series, Glenn is brewed with fresh blood oranges and corriander.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Glenn", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.springhousebeer.com/", "established": "2006", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Located in Conestoga, PA in the heart of Lancaster County.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"website": "http://www.springhousebeer.com/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Conestoga", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Pennsylvania", "countryIsoCode": "US", "longitude": -76.329515, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 39.9525, "streetAddress": "2519 Main St.", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "17516", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "RwaR3B", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nTue - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 11:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Restaurant/Ale House", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Lancaster", "createDate": "2013-03-03 21:13:34", "id": "yQQSln", "streetAddress": "25 West King Street", "postalCode": "17603", "website": "http://www.springhousebeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(717) 399-4009", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Taproom", "latitude": 40.038495, "locationType": "restaurant", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -76.306957, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Spring House", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:58:50", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W0G7sk/upload_bvG0Oh-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W0G7sk/upload_bvG0Oh-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W0G7sk/upload_bvG0Oh-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W0G7sk/upload_bvG0Oh-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W0G7sk/upload_bvG0Oh-icon.png"}, "id": "W0G7sk", "name": "Spring House Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.055", "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
