Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason\u2019s wedding to his son\u2019s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy Black Hog Brewing Company at one of our pig roasts soon or whatever occasion brings you together for great beer and food with friends and family.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-08-24 01:04:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "LoZU74", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Oxford", "createDate": "2014-08-24 01:04:56", "streetAddress": "115 Hurley Rd", "latitude": 41.4757707, "extendedAddress": "Bldg 9A", "website": "http://www.blackhogbrewing.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "06478", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Connecticut", "longitude": -73.1520822, "updateDate": "2014-08-25 11:53:08", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Black Hog", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:57:58", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_KnhGJu-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_KnhGJu-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_KnhGJu-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_KnhGJu-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WgTa5f/upload_KnhGJu-icon.png"}, "id": "WgTa5f", "name": "Black Hog Brewing Company"}], "name": "Ghost Rye' Da", "ingredients": {"hops": [{"category": "hop", "createDate": "2013-06-24 16:07:41", "categoryDisplay": "Hops", "id": 1976, "name": "#06300"}]}, "nameDisplay": "Ghost Rye' Da", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/EXuQnP/upload_T44SlY-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/EXuQnP/upload_T44SlY-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/EXuQnP/upload_T44SlY-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago.
