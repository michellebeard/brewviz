We produce inspired ales, with lots of care, in very small batches.\r\n\r\nOur custom built, 3BBL brew-house ensures a keen eye to every detail and fosters creativity in both our recipes and beer styles.\r\n\r\nDandy Ales are living beers; naturally conditioned bottles, kegs, and casks. This return to the true ale tradition ensures the living yeast in the unfiltered and unpasteurized beer will continue to work with the premium malt and complex hops from the moment it is pitched in the fermenters, until it passes your lips!\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to offer a top notch tasting room on site where you can taste any or all of our eight taps, including Dandy favourites and special one-off beers. There are also tours and a small shop to pick up a variety of Dandy merchandise!\r\n\r\nWe share a passion for not only brewing, but the people, process, experiences, and personal touches that make the real ale experience so special.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-04-06 17:27:32", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Sat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 4:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\n\nMonday-Wednesday: Closed\r\nThursday: 4pm-8pm\r\nFriday: 4pm-10pm\r\nSaturday: Noon-10pm\r\nSunday: Noon-4pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Nano Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Calgary", "createDate": "2016-04-06 17:27:33", "id": "K6PeNv", "streetAddress": "#11 1826 25TH AVENUE NE", "postalCode": "T2E 7K1", "website": "http://thedandybrewingcompany.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "phone": "+1 403-769-9399", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 51.0751355, "locationType": "nano", "region": "AB", "longitude": -114.0147848, "updateDate": "2016-05-07 15:07:46", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "The Dandy", "updateDate": "2016-05-07 15:11:07", "id": "wjSS57", "name": "The Dandy Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.056", "description": "American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors.

They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hefeweizen, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a four-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The room was once the storage area for The Boy Scouts of America Aurora chapter\u2019s canoes and the area gained the nickname \u201cCanoe Room,\u201d which stuck.\r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale).
