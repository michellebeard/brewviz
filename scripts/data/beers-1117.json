Some add it to the mash others add it to the boil and some even combine it directly to the cooled wort prior to fermentation.\r\nFor our regular Vin de Saison we added 20% Swartland Chenin blanc aquired from Mullineux Family wines. We opted for this grape variety as it\u2019s the most widely grown wine grape variety in South Africa and increasingly becoming a force to be reckoned with internationally.\r\nIn addition to our regular Vin de Saison, this year we mixed things up a bit by allowing one barrel to ferment naturally/wild without the addition of our regular Saison yeast, rather relying on yeast present on the grapes and within the barrel.\r\nSo what does a wine beer hybrid taste like?\r\nWell it\u2019s fundamentally a beer with a super fresh aroma and a lovely crisp grape derived acidity. Typically I like to describe these beers as the Champagne of the beer world.\r\nThe 2014 Vintage of Vin de Saison launched on Friday, April 14th and is now available at The Taproom and select restaurants and retailers.
