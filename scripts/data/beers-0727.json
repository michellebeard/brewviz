Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "20", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "3.8", "fgMin": "1.008", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:22:53", "fgMax": "1.02", "shortName": "Oatmeal Stout", "abvMax": "6", "id": 21, "srmMin": "20", "name": "Oatmeal Stout"}, "id": "UH7QxZ", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2013-09-10 11:52:19", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 05:29:58", "abv": "6.8", "styleId": 21, "ibu": "30", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Don't fight it, Spite It!\r\nNorm is a S.O.B.\r\n\r\nHe was born a S.O.B.\r\n\r\nAnd will always be a S.O.B.\r\n\r\nWe don't blame him, it's not his fault.\r\n\r\nSo we brewed this traditional Roggenbier\r\n\r\nwith a large percentage of malt rye, noble German hops,\r\n\r\nand Hefeweizen yeast in tribute to this\r\n\r\nGerman Short Hair Pointer.\r\n\r\nAnd if Norm could talk, he would tell you ta GET GOING!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Norm Is A Son Of A Bitch German Style Roggenbier", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/xhlVQ6/upload_8iRm1W-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/xhlVQ6/upload_8iRm1W-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/xhlVQ6/upload_8iRm1W-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.047", "description": "This beer can be made using phenol producing ale yeast. It should be brewed with at least 30 percent rye malt, and hop rates will be low. A banana -like fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; phenolic, clove-like characteristics should also be perceived. Color is straw to dark amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. If the beer is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or light caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile.
