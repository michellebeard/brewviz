A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "30", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "65", "abvMin": "6", "fgMin": "1.014", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:21:03", "fgMax": "1.03", "shortName": "Old Ale", "abvMax": "9", "id": 13, "srmMin": "12", "name": "Old Ale"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:49", "updateDate": "2014-10-08 18:17:56", "styleId": 13, "id": "TU0ZjV", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.noddinghead.com/", "established": "1999", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Philadelphia's most award winning brewery, located in the heart of Center City.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "mailingListUrl": "http://www.ripsneakers.com/nodding/main.cfm?action=Add%20Mail", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "M-Sat: 11:30am - 2am\r\nSunday Brunch: 11am - 5pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Philadelphia", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:03", "id": "QZtzPg", "streetAddress": "1516 Sansom Street", "postalCode": "19102", "extendedAddress": "2nd Floor", "website": "http://www.noddinghead.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-215-569-9525", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Brewpub", "latitude": 39.950268, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.1665735, "updateDate": "2015-10-28 15:52:26", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Nodding Head", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:53:20", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7O0xOu/upload_SBwf6H-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7O0xOu/upload_SBwf6H-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7O0xOu/upload_SBwf6H-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7O0xOu/upload_SBwf6H-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7O0xOu/upload_SBwf6H-icon.png"}, "id": "7O0xOu", "name": "Nodding Head Brewery"}], "name": "Bill Payer Ale / BPA", "nameDisplay": "Bill Payer Ale / BPA", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Mq24sa/upload_IPw7nK-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Mq24sa/upload_IPw7nK-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Mq24sa/upload_IPw7nK-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.044", "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
