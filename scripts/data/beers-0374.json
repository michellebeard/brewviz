That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:55", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "qjZIZq", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Somerdale", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:55", "streetAddress": "900 Kennedy Boulevard", "postalCode": "08083", "website": "http://www.flyingfish.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "856-504-3442", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 39.853834, "locationType": "micro", "region": "New Jersey", "longitude": -75.019803, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Flying Fish", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:46:07", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/M5zcKb/upload_itowqN-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/M5zcKb/upload_itowqN-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/M5zcKb/upload_itowqN-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/M5zcKb/upload_itowqN-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/M5zcKb/upload_itowqN-icon.png"}, "id": "M5zcKb", "name": "Flying Fish Brewing Company"}], "ibu": "11.2", "updateDate": "2015-12-18 14:48:08", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:11"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Beer is not available.", "id": 3, "name": "Not Available"}, "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Single hop brew with a refreshing maltiness.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Extra Pale Ale", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.bristolbrewing.com/", "established": "1994", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "In June of 1994, Bristol Brewing Company settled comfortably in the lap of Pikes Peak and began hand-brewing flavorful, one-of-a-kind ales for the people of Colorado.
