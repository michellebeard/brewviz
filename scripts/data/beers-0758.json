The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

And so they purchased a former tractor dealership in an historical building on the main street of Edgerton, Alberta and set about renovating.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-01-23 17:56:33", "locations": [{"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Saturdays 11am \u2013 4pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Edgerton AB", "createDate": "2016-01-29 20:55:29", "id": "hA2r8y", "streetAddress": "4924 51 Street", "postalCode": "T0B1K0", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "CA", "phone": "780-755-3008", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 52.7599651, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alberta", "longitude": -110.4620503, "updateDate": "2016-01-29 20:55:29", "country": {"displayName": "Canada", "name": "CANADA", "isoThree": "CAN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 124, "isoCode": "CA"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Ribstone Creek", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-01-29 20:53:19", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IyW9fM/upload_L9SbAy-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IyW9fM/upload_L9SbAy-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IyW9fM/upload_L9SbAy-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IyW9fM/upload_L9SbAy-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IyW9fM/upload_L9SbAy-icon.png"}, "id": "IyW9fM", "name": "Ribstone Creek Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor.
