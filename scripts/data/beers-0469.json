Bentel lived at the northeast corner of Brewery and Grainery streets, where his house remains today, as upright as when Indiana's first brewer marched out to make his beer almost two centuries ago.\r\nThe German utopian communalists in New Harmony were Indiana's first significant brewers. Beginning in 1816, the Harmonists eventually brewed enough to sell all the way up to what is now West Virginia and down into lower Illinois. From the historical record, it appears the Harmonists brewed a porter-like dark beer. It must have been pretty good beer: An educated German, Ferdinand Ernst, stopped in New Harmony during his journey through the frontier region. \u201cThey served me a stein of beer,\u201d Ernst wrote, \u201cand I was not a little astonished to find here a genuine, real Bamberg beer.\u201d He gushed that the Harmonists \u201cmust be happiest people of entire Christiandom.\u201d A Louisville agent for the Harmonists reported, \u201cMr. Breeden, the most celebrated porter seller in the place says the strongest part of it would almost pass for porter and is the best beer he has ever seen in this country\u2026", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Harmonie Dark Lager", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/KRPFir/upload_jMnwm9-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/KRPFir/upload_jMnwm9-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/KRPFir/upload_jMnwm9-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 8, "name": "North American Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "This beer's malt aroma and flavor are low but notable.

The main product produced at the brewery is Guinness Draft.\r\n\r\nLeased for 9,000 years in 1759 by Arthur Guinness at \u00a345 per year, St. James's Gate has been the home of Guinness ever since. It became the largest brewery in Ireland in 1838, and was the largest in the world in 1914, covering 64 acres. Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices associated with the brewery. The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant.\r\n\r\nThere is an attached exhibition on the 250-year-old history of Guinness, called the Guinness Storehouse.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "9RsQkk", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Dublin City", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "streetAddress": "109 James's Street", "latitude": 53.34309, "website": "http://www.guinness.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1759", "countryIsoCode": "IE", "postalCode": "8", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Dublin", "longitude": -6.290799, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Ireland", "name": "IRELAND", "isoThree": "IRL", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 372, "isoCode": "IE"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Guinness", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:38:48", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HaPdSL/upload_b3rzyZ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HaPdSL/upload_b3rzyZ-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HaPdSL/upload_b3rzyZ-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HaPdSL/upload_b3rzyZ-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HaPdSL/upload_b3rzyZ-icon.png"}, "id": "HaPdSL", "name": "Guinness"}], "description": "The best selling premium irish import lager in the world today.

Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness.

I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to \"550 degrees\"? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night.

That\u2019s what craft beer is\u2026a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well\u2026..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.\r\n\r\nOnce NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik\u2019s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park\u2019s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers. We should all thank our lucky stars that we live in a state with such high quality Breweries.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-07-25 13:35:25", "locations": [{"website": "http://350Brewing.com", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Tinley Park", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "countryIsoCode": "US", "longitude": -87.7911748, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 41.5593734, "streetAddress": "7144 183rd St", "createDate": "2014-07-25 13:36:01", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-03 19:00:50", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "60477", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "1mRL8J", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "350", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:56:23", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_uohtEs-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_uohtEs-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_uohtEs-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_uohtEs-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_uohtEs-icon.png"}, "id": "W3pb09", "name": "350 Brewing Company"}], "name": "Harry Patersbier", "nameDisplay": "Harry Patersbier", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LDmmyY/upload_uiPj7k-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LDmmyY/upload_uiPj7k-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/LDmmyY/upload_uiPj7k-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.03", "description": "These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.
