We are a family company born of a deep passion for beer and a great reverence for brewing history, tradition and culture. Our motto is Celebrating Beer. This, to us, means the comprehensive enjoyment of beer in a way that enhances the overall experience of life.\r\n\r\nThe basic formula for our entire lineup of hand-crafted Baird Beer is the same: Balance + Complexity = Character. We are dedicated to the crafting of beer that bursts with flavor and character. We will not brew vapid beer and we are not afraid of not appealing to everyone. We brew to our own exacting standards and it is our daily mission to not disappoint ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn addition to crafting Baird Beer, we also own and directly operate a growing stable of beer pubs which we call our Taprooms (Numazu Fishmarket Taproom, Nakameguro Taproom, etc.). Baird Beer also is sold through a steadily expanding family of outside pubs, restaurants and liquor stores in Japan as well as being exported to select international markets. Consumer purchases of Baird Beer direct from the brewery are possible through our online estore (delivery only within Japan).", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "AzIZR4", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Numazu", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "streetAddress": "9-3, Tadehara-cho", "postalCode": "410-0843", "website": "http://bairdbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2000", "countryIsoCode": "JP", "phone": "055-952-6673", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 35.082445, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Shizuoka", "longitude": 138.861084, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Japan", "name": "JAPAN", "isoThree": "JPN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 392, "isoCode": "JP"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Baird", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:27:37", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NDPKIS/upload_IN2zqq-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NDPKIS/upload_IN2zqq-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NDPKIS/upload_IN2zqq-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NDPKIS/upload_IN2zqq-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/NDPKIS/upload_IN2zqq-icon.png"}, "id": "NDPKIS", "name": "Baird Brewing Company"}], "description": "This cloudy, golden-hued wheat based ale is fresh and wholesome like a newly baked loaf of bread.

However, we soon realized we were somewhat limited and constrained by which beers were actually available in the Miami market -due to distribution and other factors. And since we're all about unfettered drinking and out of the box thinking, the concept soon changed to: \"let's brew our own!\". This way we would be free to experiment with both well known and more obscure styles and experiment with flavor profiles and combinations. The possibilities, which once looked constrained, now appeared limitless.\r\n\r\nEnter Robert Tejon and Seth Hammond! After meeting and networking within Miami's local brewer community for the better part of a year, Diego met Robert and Seth. They decided to start making some test batches, which eventually led to making one-off pilot batches for nationally-renowned events (please see our \"events\" section). As momentum gathered, we realized that there was great potential in this concept and decided that the brewpub was definitely the way we wanted to go.\r\n\r\nAs Gravity Brew Lab, our mission is to bring you uncompromising, top quality beer.

We didn't agree (barleywine, anyone?) and appealed their rejection. Ours is the first, but definitely not the last, wheat wine application the federal government has seen, so they had to create new guidelines regarding the use of this name.
