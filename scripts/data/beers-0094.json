On smelling some of his used barrels we thought they would be the perfect vessel to age some of our Ninkasi in. The cider brandy flavours naturally combine beautifully with the apple flavours in the beer and the farmyard brettanomyces character in the beer has become more dominant. This is a beer we always wanted to make and we are delighted to say, it doesn't disappoint. Not as highly carbonated as the \"normal\" Ninkasi, this is softer, more mellow, with a long lingering fruit character. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRaconteur - an aged barley wine, that has spent the last 9 months slowly developing in Marc de Bourgogne casks. We bought the barrels with this beer in mind, as soon as we opened them up the aroma that hit us screamed barley wine at us. It's a dark, warming style of bar, with a rich, boozy, fruitcake character. The big flavours and warming alcohol make this the perfect winter beer. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhiskebeest - a year ago we put 2 barrels worth of Wildebeest in Whisky barrels - it was all we could spare. The rich chocolate, vanilla and coffee flavours have melded beautifully with the Whisky and the wood to produce a smooth and mellow beer.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "lAcrbq", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Gadsden", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "streetAddress": "200 North 6th St.", "postalCode": "35901", "website": "http://www.backfortybeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "256-467-4912", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 34.015484, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alabama", "longitude": -86.005585, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Back Forty", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:06:39", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_OtE4O6-icon.png"}, "id": "KkUzjZ", "name": "Back Forty Beer Company"}], "description": "Ale aged in oak barrels", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Barrel-Aged Naked Pig Pale Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OO7gTR/upload_0bc8QK-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OO7gTR/upload_0bc8QK-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OO7gTR/upload_0bc8QK-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "Any classic style or unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.
