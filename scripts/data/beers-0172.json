Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company.

The second was used for a less strong \u201ctable beer,\u201d and the third, a lighter and cheaper \u201csmall beer.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur Bone Warmer is brewed the same way, using only the first runnings from an extraordinarily thick, strong mash of Idaho 2-Row Metcalfe and Harrington barley malt, along with dark German munich and caramel malts. We subtly spiced it with \u201cnoble\u201d character American Perle and Mt. Hood hops, fermented it at cool temperatures and cold-conditioned it for smoothness and drinkability.\r\n\r\nThe resulting ale is the color of roasting chestnuts, voluptuously malty, only slightly sweet, with a hint of toffee and a warming dry finish.

This brewery has been a long time coming with lots of hard work, sweat and tears but all the hard work has finally paid off. In so many ways Silverking was meant to be! Our location is 325 East Lemon Street in Tarpon Springs, FL, which is the original Tarpon Springs Jail / Fire House. The original jail dates back to 1909 and is considered a historical part of the building. In 1950 the fire house portion of the building was added. Because of this our renovations had to be done with much care. \r\n\r\nAfter acquiring the building, research began to learn more about its history. Note that the name of the business had already been identified, Silverking Brewing Company. Silverking was chosen because its nickname for one of the world's greatest sportfish, the highly sought after Tarpon. \r\n\r\nOur historical research led us to the name of Tarpon Spring's original Sheriff/Marshal, Marshal Rueben T. Jones. When located the only picture of him on record, much to our amazement there he was standing on the Sponge Docks with a 150lb Tarpon hanging next to him!! Silverking! This was so exciting....How IRONIC! \r\n\r\nAs we continued with renovations and we were trying to decide on replacing the ceiling tiles in the tasting room, we uncovered the gorgeous wood ceiling. As we began ripping the ceiling tiles out, tile by tile...out from the ceiling fell old beer bottles and liquor bottles from who knows when! We truly believe these were nothing but pure signs that Silverking Brewing Company was meant to be in this old historical building!! \r\n\r\nSo who knows what stories these walls hold. We definitely plan to hold on to this fascinating history and bring you more interesting facts and pay homage to the history within this building and this great City..Tarpon Springs, FL. Be sure when you visit to see the old antique bottles and pictures of Marshal Rueben T. Jones on display. We look forward to sharing with you!\r\n\r\nGreat Beer...built by Fisherman and Outdoorsman.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer.

Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging.

Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.

Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida.
