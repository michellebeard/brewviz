Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "25", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "30", "ibuMax": "35", "abvMin": "6.2", "fgMin": "1.016", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:21:11", "fgMax": "1.028", "shortName": "Scotch Ale", "abvMax": "8", "id": 15, "srmMin": "15", "name": "Scotch Ale"}, "id": "VS42fb", "createDate": "2016-10-31 13:52:04", "updateDate": "2016-10-31 13:52:04", "abv": "7.7", "styleId": 15, "ibu": "19", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Smells like Granny's house on a cool fall afternoon.
