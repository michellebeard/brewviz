Through its first three seasons, the critically acclaimed drama has become the biggest show on HBO. Take the Black Stout follows the highly coveted Iron Throne Blonde Ale, which flew off of shelves earlier this year. To satisfy the appetite of Game of Thrones fans, production of Take the Black Stout will more than double the final volumes of Iron Throne Blonde Ale. \r\n\r\nInspired by the brotherhood of the Night\u2019s Watch, Take the Black Stout was made to be deep, dark and complex like those who have sworn the oath to defend Westeros against threats from the north. The label depicts the Weirwood tree where Jon Snow recited the oath before joining the Night\u2019s Watch. \r\n\r\nThe beer pours black with a good amount of tan head (though the kegs were pouring a bit foamy). Aroma has a rich chocolate malt with a good amount of red fruit. The mouthfeel has an average carbonation with a medium body. The flavor starts on a rich red fruit flavor, reminiscent of plum, that moves to a roasty malt with hints of chocolate and molasses that finishes on a subtle licorice bite. The aftertaste has a slightly dry, chalky mouthfeel possessing a lingering licorice flavor with a slight bitterness. As you drink it a slight warming develops in the back of the palate\r\n\r\nIn time for the holidays, Take the Black Stout makes for the perfect gift.

A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.
