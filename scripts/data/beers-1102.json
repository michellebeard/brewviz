We brew high quality beers with an uncompromising focus on detail, from the ingredient selection to the brewing process. A specially designed JV Northwest brewing system creates more flavorful beers by allowing more barley to be used in the brewing process.  We also use a special bottling machine that keeps the beer fresher, and extends storage times compared to other conventional microbrewery bottling machines. This is very beneficial to retain all the character of these flavorful styles of beer.\r\n\r\nHoppin\u2019 Frog is the concept of owner and established brewmaster Fred Karm, who has designed and produced more award-winning beers than any other professional brewer in Ohio since 2000. All of these awards were won at the 2 most prestigious contests in the world, including the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

As downtown Long Beach\u2019s only independent craft brewery, we strive to make sure our passion for craft beer shines through with every sip.\r\n\r\nOur award-winning Brewmaster, Julian Shrago, spends countless hours perfecting each recipe, researching new ones, and pushing the boundaries of craft beer brewing today. Our general philosophy on brewing is to always think of flavor first. No matter how creative you want to be, beer, much like food, must taste good (or hopefully outstanding).\r\n\r\nWe brew a wide variety of American styles, as well as some traditional British, German, and Belgian-style beers. Having a large variety of beers keeps customers excited and creates a sense of adventure associated with the brand. It also allows us to have unlimited creative freedom, and that always keeps things fresh.

Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "5", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "50", "ibuMax": "70", "abvMin": "2.5", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:44:21", "fgMax": "1.03", "shortName": "Fruit Beer", "abvMax": "12", "id": 119, "srmMin": "5", "name": "Fruit Beer"}, "id": "bGnZRB", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-05-22 10:07:58", "updateDate": "2016-04-15 19:24:18", "abv": "4.8", "styleId": 119, "availableId": 4, "glasswareId": 5, "ibu": "10", "srm": {"hex": "CB6200", "id": 13, "name": "13"}, "name": "UFO R.A.Z."}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/", "established": "1986", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because\u2014like today\u2014we loved beer and wanted more quality choices.  \r\n\r\nThere was only one problem: we were beer lovers, not brewers. We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.
