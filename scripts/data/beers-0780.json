They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Paddleboard Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They brew many seasonals throughout the year including: Snow Park XPA, Slippery Slope, Skookum Creek Ale, Paulina Lake Pilsner, Waste Deep Weiss, Riverside Red, Silverback Imperial Stout, Kolsch, IRA, etc. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery store.\r\n\r\nPHIL BREY \u2013 HEAD BREWER\r\nPhil brings 25 years of winemaking and brewing experience to Cascade Lakes Brewing Co. Phil started home brewing in college while working on his degree in Enology (winemaking) at Fresno State. Phil started with some winemaking stints in California at Mirassou Winery and Bogle Vineyards before moving to Bend. He began his professional brewing career at Deschutes Brewery.

The self-serve beer wall, The Downpour, allow patrons to sample, select, and pour their own beer.  We are importing beers from both Europe and across America to supplement our soon to be released beer line.  A collaborative effort of Matt MacNeil and Adam Hoffman, the goals of the company are simple: Great Beer, Great Food, and Great Service.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Historic CP&L Garage, the space has been renovated to bring back the industrial feel that the Powerhouse Square District deserves.  With garage doors that connect the patio to the restaurant, exposed columns, and I-beams, as well as a custom concrete bar with reclaimed wood accents, we\u2019ve blended the modern with the historic.  The industrial atmosphere has been infused with technology wherever possible. Wi-Fi tablets for tableside service, LED lighting, and of course The Downpour (our self-serve beer wall), all come together to create a space that feels both raw and unfinished, yet modern and  functional.  Come enjoy a drink with friends, cheer your favorite team to victory, or host a company event.\r\n\r\nA bar and restaurant focused on craft beer, Clouds Brewing is home to The Downpour; using RFID technology you can start a tab and pour your own beer. And the best part is you pay by the ounce, not by the pint! Feel free to try a small taste of each beer, or a pint of your favorite\u2014the choice is yours. With 10 rotating taps there is always something new to try, and with no need to buy whole pints, you can try them all! So seriously, come on down, grab a glass, and \u201cExperience the Downpour!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur bar features 40 beers on draft with 10 of those located on The Downpour.

This was the second business venture for Corcoran whom had been making award winning wines since 2004. Corcoran which is family owned and operated decided in 2011 to branch out into the hand crafted beer industry. Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard / brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage \u2014 an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-04-08 13:11:43", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "Zhydrx", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Vista", "createDate": "2014-04-08 13:13:42", "streetAddress": "2545 Progress Street", "postalCode": "92081", "extendedAddress": "Suite D", "website": "http://boozebrothersbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(760) 295-0217", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.148172, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.218047, "updateDate": "2015-08-26 16:23:19", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Booze Brothers", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:53:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-icon.png"}, "id": "xaBLno", "name": "Booze Brothers Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.

We truly believe you should follow your passion and enjoy life. How better to do that than open Thirsty Planet Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nOur purpose then morphs into doing the right thing. For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.
