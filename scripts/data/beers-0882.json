Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself.  With this approach you get \u2018scientific\u2019 beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That\u2019s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.

Both had a faithful following of friends and family who loved their beers. When the two of them began to collaborate and brew together the synergy took their beer recipes to a new level. When the two of them got an opportunity to help start the first brewery in Cullman since the 1880s, they jumped at it. They along with John Dean and Brad Glenn formed the Blue Moose Brew Crew. They brewed their beers and served them at the Blue Moose Caf\u00e9 and Brewpub in 2013. The beers were a huge success. The success of this venture convinced the four friends to open their own brewery.

The water, the most important prerequisite for a good beer, gives us a strong advantage in quality. The fresh water of the Swedish North is the best water from which to make beer.
