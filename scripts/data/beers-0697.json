Brewing in a renovated dairy barn, we brew American-style farmhouse ales with German, English and Belgian influences. Water is taken from our own springs and lends to our signature flavor. Our beer is made with natural ingredients and no pretense. We've been known to throw in a few spices or fruits into our beer. Our most popular beer, Pork Slap Pale Ale is sweet and malty, brewed with fresh ginger root. Heinnieweisse is a German-style weissebier with tart citrus and banana notes. For all our hopheads, Snapperhead is an American IPA with light spicy and earthy hop flavors. And don't forget about Moo Thunder American Stout with its espresso, dark chocolate, smoky flavor.\r\nWe change up the beer on draft pretty regularly, so stop by often. You can sample all our year-round brews, plus any specialty styles we have on draft. Take a tour of our brewery and learn about the brewing process, ingredients and history. Our beer is available for sale in 6-packs or cases and don't forget to bring your growler.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "mailingListUrl": "http://butternutsbeerandale.com/emailForm.html", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon - Sun: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Garrattsville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "id": "ZiwDNN", "streetAddress": "4021 State Highway", "postalCode": "13342", "website": "http://butternutsbeerandale.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2005", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "607-263-5070", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 42.6469262, "locationType": "micro", "region": "New York", "longitude": -75.1837216, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Butternuts Beer and Ale", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:11:12", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9BPs2d/upload_opWU5V-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9BPs2d/upload_opWU5V-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9BPs2d/upload_opWU5V-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9BPs2d/upload_opWU5V-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9BPs2d/upload_opWU5V-icon.png"}, "id": "9BPs2d", "name": "Butternuts Beer and Ale"}], "description": "This stout beer pays tribute to the Butternuts Brewery's former life as a dairy farm.
