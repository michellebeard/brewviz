Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it\u2019s capacity, and soon Fegley\u2019s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities. Perhaps there\u2019s another fragrant wallflower ready to dance.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "Jio9R0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Allentown", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:44", "streetAddress": "812 W Hamilton St", "postalCode": "18101", "website": "http://www.thebrewworks.com/allentown-brewworks/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1998", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "610.433.7777", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Fegley's Allentown Brew Works", "latitude": 40.6013531, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.4739451, "updateDate": "2015-10-21 15:03:28", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Fegley's Bethlehem Brew Works", "locality": "Bethlehem", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -75.3821851, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "610-882-1300", "streetAddress": "569 Main Street", "createDate": "2015-10-21 15:03:28", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-10-21 15:03:28", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "18018", "latitude": 40.6222629, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "SAPoSh", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Fegley's Brew Works", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:38:31", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Rx4Dnt/upload_N2X3bi-icon.png"}, "id": "Rx4Dnt", "name": "Fegley's Brew Works"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.", "createDate": "2015-04-07 17:21:44", "categoryId": 11, "shortName": "Wild Beer", "id": 170, "name": "Wild Beer"}, "srm": {"hex": "FFD878", "id": 2, "name": "2"}, "createDate": "2015-10-25 01:34:53", "updateDate": "2015-10-26 17:21:45", "abv": "3.8", "styleId": 170, "id": "bVJhRq", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available year round as a staple beer.", "id": 1, "name": "Year Round"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.commonsbrewery.com/", "established": "2011", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The Commons Brewery is a small craft brewery located in Southeast Portland, Oregon.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Th & Fri: 5-9-ish \r\nSaturday 2-9-ish \r\nSunday 2-6", "locationTypeDisplay": "Nano Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Portland", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:10", "id": "jqK43H", "streetAddress": "630 SE Belmont St.", "postalCode": "97214", "website": "http://www.commonsbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "503-819-0758", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 45.5163203, "locationType": "nano", "region": "Oregon", "longitude": -122.6589905, "updateDate": "2015-04-02 15:26:35", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "The Commons", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-23 18:56:20", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/t9cCJ5/upload_hlNrgu-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/t9cCJ5/upload_hlNrgu-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/t9cCJ5/upload_hlNrgu-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/t9cCJ5/upload_hlNrgu-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/t9cCJ5/upload_hlNrgu-icon.png"}, "id": "t9cCJ5", "name": "The Commons Brewery"}], "description": "Urban Farmhouse Ale is a light , crisp and refreshing farmhouse ale.\r\n\r\nBronze Medal Winner 2012 World Beer Cup\r\n2013 Beer of the Year: Willamette Week\r\nBest Beer 2012 by Portland Tribune\r\nBest Belgian Style in the 2012  Northwest Brewing News Peoples Choice Awards", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Urban Farmhouse Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eLf8UR/upload_UGydWk-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eLf8UR/upload_UGydWk-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/eLf8UR/upload_UGydWk-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.055", "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.
