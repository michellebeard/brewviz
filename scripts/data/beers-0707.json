For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co.

While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds \u2013 beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.\r\n\r\nWhile German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.

It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "wbpj5b", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "streetAddress": "1675 N Western Ave", "latitude": 41.9124445, "website": "http://www.pipeworksbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "60647", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.6869011, "updateDate": "2016-07-22 20:13:38", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Pipeworks", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:04:15", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-icon.png"}, "id": "fz3g3i", "name": "Pipeworks Brewing Company"}], "description": "A variation on Santa vs Unicorn, but with English yeast, much less hops, a bit sweeter with more caramel, and just a hint of Nelson Sauvin.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Murderous", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/6KrT9b/upload_YgD6fm-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/6KrT9b/upload_YgD6fm-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/6KrT9b/upload_YgD6fm-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.085", "description": "British-style barley wines range from tawny copper to dark brown in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.
