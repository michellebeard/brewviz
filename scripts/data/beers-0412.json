By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars.

While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "wbpj5b", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "streetAddress": "1675 N Western Ave", "latitude": 41.9124445, "website": "http://www.pipeworksbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "postalCode": "60647", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.6869011, "updateDate": "2016-07-22 20:13:38", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Pipeworks", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:04:15", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fz3g3i/upload_pFeJAW-icon.png"}, "id": "fz3g3i", "name": "Pipeworks Brewing Company"}], "name": "Froggy Style", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Froggy Style", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OQWcEz/upload_7ns4Eb-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OQWcEz/upload_7ns4Eb-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/OQWcEz/upload_7ns4Eb-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.04", "description": "Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
