From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DrFlD0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Carlsbad", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "571 Carlsbad Village Dr.", "postalCode": "92008", "website": "http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/carlsbad/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "760-720-7007", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Carlsbad", "latitude": 33.1596505, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.3478111, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun - Thur - 11am - 10pm\r\nFri - Sat. - 11am - Midnight", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Solana Beach", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "qAyZMR", "streetAddress": "135 N.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.
