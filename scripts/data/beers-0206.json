Mild ales are traditionally referred to as \"session ales\" known for their low alcohol content which is around 3.2 - 4.0%. Despite their low alcohol content, Milds are just as flavorful as beers with a higher ABV. In crafting this beer we used only the finest malt's and hop's from England. Burial at Sea starts with a great malty nose boasting aromas of milk chocolate and biscuity sweetness. The beer has a medium mouthfeel that drinks with a soft, mineral smoothness and just enough hops to counter the chewy malt character. Fermented with a clean American yeast that lets the oats, barley and hops dominate and take center stage.\r\n\r\nThis beer is dedicated to the brave souls who made the pilgrimage from the old world to the new and the souls whom never saw the shores of the new world on the horizon.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Burial at Sea", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.dcbrau.com", "established": "2009", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "The fact that D.C. has become a world-class beer town is undeniable.
