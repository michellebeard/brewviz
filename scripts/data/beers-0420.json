Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is currently distributed in:\r\nColorado:\r\nC.R.

Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new \u201cmicrobreweries\u201d all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.\r\nUntil 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town\u2019s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery\u2019s demise.\r\nBig Muddy Brewing\u2019s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago\u2019s Rosati\u2019s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.\r\nIt was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.\r\nStuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.\r\nStuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.\r\nThe first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg\u2019s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good \u201ccraft beer transition brew\u201d for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).\r\nKinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s second selection, \u201cSaluki Dunkel Dog\u201d, a dark, amber/dunkel style beer.\r\nThe third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s lineup is an ale called \u201cBig Muddy Pale Ale\u201d, and future varieties include \u201cLogan\u2019s Lager\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Murphysboro", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:46", "id": "QkdgSV", "streetAddress": "1430 North 7th Street", "postalCode": "62966", "website": "http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2009", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(618) 684-8833", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 37.7823381, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -89.3321145, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Big Muddy", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:18:15", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_W7yNNA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_W7yNNA-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_W7yNNA-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_W7yNNA-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_W7yNNA-icon.png"}, "id": "oBe8dQ", "name": "Big Muddy Brewing Co"}], "name": "Galaxy India Pale Ale", "nameDisplay": "Galaxy India Pale Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/1sqxOk/upload_Leq7bi-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/1sqxOk/upload_Leq7bi-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/1sqxOk/upload_Leq7bi-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

It was a dream inspired by a trip to Alaska and a love for the outdoors, and one day, darn it, they were going to make it happen.\r\n\r\nThe couple moved to Tahoe, where Todd put his culinary degree to work as a sous chef while they skied. It was here that they decided it was time to become self-sufficient. Todd had every intention of making their own soap, toothpaste, even toilet paper. But one thing haunted him\u2026 he didn\u2019t want to live without beer. He had no choice; the first step was to learn how to make his own. And that was also the last step.\r\n\r\nTodd\u2019s natural knack for home brewing, made with borrowed equipment, quickly trumped the couple\u2019s off-the-grid dreams. And let\u2019s just say that Lisa wasn\u2019t all that disappointed\u2026now she didn\u2019t have to use the homemade toilet paper for starters, but she also got to drink some damn good beer. Todd and Lisa had never tasted such fine brew, and they knew they were on to something special.\r\n\r\nThat was just the beginning of the journey towards Bozone beer. The rest goes something like this\u2026\r\n\r\nTodd refined his beer making skills for a brewery in Calistoga, while working another job and taking classes on the art and science of beer fermentation at UC Davis. But all the while, Montana beckoned.\r\n\r\nTodd scored a job as the head brewer for Spanish Peaks in Bozeman\u2015a position he held for 10 years\u2015and Lisa worked for the City. When Spanish Peaks moved production to California, Todd and Lisa knew it was time to bring their own fine brews to the beer drinkers of Bozeman. They bought the equipment and opened the doors to the Bozeman Brewing Company warehouse in 2001, on the edge of Bozeman\u2019s historic Brewery District on the north side.\r\n\r\nThere, Bozeman Brewing\u2019s flagship beer, Bozone Select Amber Ale (based on a recipe that Todd had perfected over the years), made its way to the beer drinkers of Montana and beyond.

Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Fort Mill", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "South Carolina", "longitude": -80.956275, "isClosed": "Y", "phone": "803-619-9295", "streetAddress": "802 Somerton Drive", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:08", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-08-25 14:13:48", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "29715", "latitude": 35.011366, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "kXV5lc", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"inPlanning": "Y", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Hickory Location", "locality": "Hickory", "openToPublic": "N", "locationType": "micro", "region": "North Carolina", "longitude": -81.325672, "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 35.735156, "streetAddress": "883 Highland Ave SE", "createDate": "2012-04-20 18:52:08", "status": "verified", "yearOpened": "2012", "updateDate": "2016-08-25 14:13:48", "postalCode": "28602", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "TjzLgu", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Skull Coast Ales", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:13:41", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_HuVGg7-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_HuVGg7-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_HuVGg7-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_HuVGg7-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_HuVGg7-icon.png"}, "id": "HX4Prz", "name": "Skull Coast Ales"}], "description": "Our Fall & Winter Seasonal, Gallows Point, is an Imperial Porter made with real Chocolate & Macadamia Nuts.
