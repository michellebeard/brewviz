Well, maybe our taproom/brewing facility isn\u2019t literally in our backyard \u2013 in fact we renovated a soda bottling plant to suit all of our production needs \u2013 but with such a close-knit and supportive community, every inch of Virginia feels like home.\r\n\r\nBrothers Craft Brewing (originally Three Brothers Brewing) was founded by the three Shifflett siblings, who used their collective experience to execute a singular vision: brew exciting, unique craft beers that emphasize and support our community.\r\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long to realize that same community was our extended family. The three of us may be related by blood, but our staff, our customers, and our collaborators have all become brothers.\r\n\r\nWhen thinking about the people we\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with and making sure we had the ability to continue to grow, we made the bold decision to rebrand our business as Brothers Craft Brewing.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges associated with such a change, we feel that our new name truly represents our evolution as a business. Why limit our brotherhood to three when we\u2019ve gained so much family already?\r\n\r\nWhen we started this endeavor, we couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined the growth we\u2019ve been so fortunate to experience. Since beginning production in December of 2012, we\u2019ve had the honor of taking home various awards, expanding our production facilities and distribution, but most importantly we\u2019ve been able to share our passion for meticulously crafted, delicious beer with each of our fans.\r\n\r\nSo thank you all for everything you\u2019ve done for us. Thank you for keeping our dream alive.\r\n\r\nCheers!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-02-23 14:39:19", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "8n537L", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Harrisonburg", "createDate": "2013-02-23 14:40:25", "streetAddress": "800 North Main St.", "postalCode": "22802", "website": "https://brotherscraftbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(540) 435-6008", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.4576002, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Virginia", "longitude": -78.8612002, "updateDate": "2016-09-14 13:02:49", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brothers Craft", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-02-19 20:57:46", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/R4fiI1/upload_GjoLOp-icon.png"}, "id": "R4fiI1", "name": "Brothers Craft Brewing"}], "name": "Ordinary Bitter", "srmId": 7, "nameDisplay": "Ordinary Bitter", "servingTemperatureDisplay": "Cool - (8-12C/45-54F)", "originalGravity": "1.038", "id": "nHHujU", "servingTemperature": "cool", "createDate": "2015-06-29 16:19:53", "updateDate": "2015-06-29 17:11:40", "abv": "3.4", "styleId": 3, "availableId": 2, "srm": {"hex": "F39C00", "id": 7, "name": "7"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.033", "description": "Ordinary bitter is gold to copper colored with medium bitterness, light to medium body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm).

At least one regional combination of ingredients and/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager.
