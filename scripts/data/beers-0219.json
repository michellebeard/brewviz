Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It\u2019s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis pub is part of the community, and I don\u2019t just mean geographically,\u201d said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we\u2019re connected with the people and that they can trust that they\u2019ll feel at home here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he\u2019s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I\u2019ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s impressive.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown.

We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year.

We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source.

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-05-10 18:56:21", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "oN5ry0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Bangor", "createDate": "2013-05-10 19:02:53", "streetAddress": "570 Main Street", "postalCode": "04401", "website": "http://www.geaghanspub.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "207-945-3730", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 44.786998, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Maine", "longitude": -68.777343, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Geaghan Brothers", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:42:57", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_Fwpywr-icon.png"}, "id": "jmyqSv", "name": "Geaghan Brothers Brewing"}], "originalGravity": "1.069", "id": "SSjf7o", "createDate": "2015-04-22 16:26:19", "updateDate": "2015-04-22 16:26:19", "abv": "7.5", "styleId": 30, "foodPairings": "Boneless Wings, Spicy foods, Steak", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
