The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.

It should be brewed with at least 30 percent rye malt, and hop rates will be low. A banana -like fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; phenolic, clove-like characteristics should also be perceived. Color is straw to dark amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. If the beer is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or light caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "10", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "25", "ibuMax": "15", "abvMin": "4.9", "fgMin": "1.008", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:44:17", "fgMax": "1.016", "shortName": "German Rye", "abvMax": "5.5", "id": 118, "srmMin": "4", "name": "German-Style Rye Ale (Roggenbier) with or without Yeast"}, "name": "Powderfinger Rye Ale", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:44:00", "updateDate": "2012-03-22 13:05:18", "styleId": 118, "availableId": 4, "id": "vmIePN", "glasswareId": 5}]
