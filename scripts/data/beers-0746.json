That is why we aim to bring a line of clean easy-drinking English inspired ales that everyone can enjoy to the Triangle area in late 2013. \r\n\r\nWe love beer with extreme flavors or high alcohol content as much as the next guy, but that's not for everyone, which is why we will be producing extremely balanced and flavorful beers at a lower alcohol level that will be easily approachable and everyone will be able to find a beer that they enjoy in our lineup.\r\n\r\nFortnight Brewing is a true partnership of local and English flavors. The company's ownership consists of both English citizens and North Carolina natives, and our beers will utilize premium English malts and hops as well as locally-grown ingredients. \r\n\r\nFortnight Brewing will be located in Cary NC with plans of opening in Summer or Fall of 2013.
