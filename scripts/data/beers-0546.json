Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage.

As you might be able to tell, the name of our beers have connections to the places in our past, especially derived from memories and places in our community and our state.\r\n\r\nOur name, Peace Tree Brewing Company, is also a reminder, a prompting of our past where different cultures met to discuss, trade, and come to agreements. The Peace Tree is a historic grand sycamore tree that was located near the town of Red Rock under what is now Lake Red Rock. Supposedly the old sycamore was a place where Indians met for generations, then became a meeting place for fur traders. Indian treaties were negotiated here and there is some speculation that it marks the Red Rock Line.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "h9obbv", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Knoxville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:05", "streetAddress": "107 W Main Street", "postalCode": "50138", "website": "http://www.peacetreebrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "641-842-2739", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.3189315, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Iowa", "longitude": -93.098861, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Peace Tree", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-27 14:49:05", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zOXpwx/upload_J6M9GC-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zOXpwx/upload_J6M9GC-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zOXpwx/upload_J6M9GC-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zOXpwx/upload_J6M9GC-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zOXpwx/upload_J6M9GC-icon.png"}, "id": "zOXpwx", "name": "Peace Tree Brewing Company"}], "name": "Imperial Stout", "nameDisplay": "Imperial Stout", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/403eKw/upload_D1bnMl-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/403eKw/upload_D1bnMl-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/403eKw/upload_D1bnMl-icon.png"}, "originalGravity": "1.092", "createDate": "2013-11-17 00:27:13", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 08:17:40", "abv": "10", "styleId": 43, "availableId": 4, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.08", "description": "Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science.

Imperial Stout is the beer was originally developed for the Tsar's court in St. Petersburg. Petersburg. In the 1800s, this beer very popular. The beer bryggedes in England and sailed to Russia. In order to withstand the long journey was done beer extra strong compared to the Stout, sold in England. The beer was drained often champagne bottles.\r\n\r\nThe high alcohol content of 8% is to ensure the durability of the black beer. There used unrefined cane sugar from Mauritius as extra flavoring. Most English ales are brewed with unrefined cane sugar. By using unrefined sugar, you get tasting notes from cane sugar in the finished beer. The color is in the bright end of the scale. On the other hand, there is no added caramel color in this Stout!\r\n\r\n The taste of Aarhus Brewery Stout is thick and bold. Although it is a strong beer, it is not the hops that are dominant. This makes it easier to access than many other black beer. There is also a slight sweetness from cane sugar that is balanced with the hops. In time, hop bitterness subside, and the sweetness will dominate.\r\n\r\nThe young Stout will be a good companion to a piece of dark meat or a heavy casserole. It will certainly be obvious to drink for Christmas War or pork roast. Danish Yule developed over centuries, where we always have been drinking beer. Therefore suitable beer is just better to Danish cuisine.\r\n\r\nAarhus Brewery Stout will also be an excellent companion for all cheeses. Try to serve bread with cheese. Bread and Stouten will lift and compliment the cheeses.\r\n\r\nServing temperature of Aarhus Brewery Stout allowed to be about 10 degrees. It does not matter that the further warmed in the glass, it can easily tolerate.\r\n\r\nIn time, hop bitterness removable and sweetness will dominate.
