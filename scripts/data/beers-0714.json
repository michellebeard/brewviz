[{"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "This India Pale Ale features a new experimental hop from New Zealand called Nelson Sauvin.  The creator, Nelson, was reminded of New Zealand\u2019s famed Sauvignon Blanc grapes.  This boutique hop features a brilliant bouquet of aromatics that is very unique.
