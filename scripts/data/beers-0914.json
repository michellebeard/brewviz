The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013.

It is the city's oldest remaining brewpub and was the first to make a significant mark on the national brewpub and microbrewery scene. Louisville's best beer is made at this location, and large glass windows in the back dining room allow you to witness the brewing operation. The headbrewer is Jerry Gnagy, assisted by Sam Cruz and Cody Mingus.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Sunday -Thursday: 11 AM -11 PM (kitchen closes at 10)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11 AM -1 PM (kitchen closes at 11)", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Louisville", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:47", "id": "8yIWus", "streetAddress": "3929 Shelbyville Rd.", "postalCode": "40207", "website": "http://www.bbcbrew.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1993", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "502-899-7070", "isClosed": "N", "name": "BBC East St Matthews", "latitude": 38.2530375, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Kentucky", "longitude": -85.6538327, "updateDate": "2015-02-16 18:30:08", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday: 11 AM -10 PM\r\nFriday - Saturday: 11 AM -11 PM\r\nClosed Sunday", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Louisville", "createDate": "2012-04-15 19:11:15", "id": "f78xIY", "streetAddress": "660 South 4th Street", "postalCode": "40202", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2006", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "502-568-2224", "isClosed": "N", "name": "BBC Theatre Square", "latitude": 38.246998, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Kentucky", "longitude": -85.758183, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday - Thursday: 11 AM \u2013 Midnight\r\nFriday - Saturday: 11 AM \u2013 1 AM\r\nSunday: Noon \u2013 9PM", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Louisville", "createDate": "2012-04-15 19:12:22", "id": "HQrlRz", "streetAddress": "300 West Main Street", "postalCode": "40202", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2010", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "502-562-0007", "isClosed": "N", "name": "BBC 3rd and Main", "latitude": 38.256433, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Kentucky", "longitude": -85.755058, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Bluegrass", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:40:11", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ERW6Da/upload_4a6gIP-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ERW6Da/upload_4a6gIP-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ERW6Da/upload_4a6gIP-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ERW6Da/upload_4a6gIP-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ERW6Da/upload_4a6gIP-icon.png"}, "id": "ERW6Da", "name": "Bluegrass Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 5, "name": "Belgian And French Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.055", "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color. There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.004", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:34:55", "fgMax": "1.016", "shortName": "Saison", "abvMax": "8.5", "id": 72, "srmMin": "4", "name": "French & Belgian-Style Saison"}, "id": "ZNC0NS", "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2014-06-13 20:02:37", "updateDate": "2014-10-13 18:53:04", "abv": "4.9", "styleId": 72, "availableId": 2, "glasswareId": 5, "ibu": "31", "name": "Saison"}]
