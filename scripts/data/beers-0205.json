We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen.

Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "mailingListUrl": "http://burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Berlin", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:49", "id": "dB9k9t", "streetAddress": "10016 Old Ocean City Blvd", "postalCode": "21811", "website": "http://www.burleyoak.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2011", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "410-422-8887", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 38.3338561, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Maryland", "longitude": -75.2169099, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Burley Oak Craft", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:17:12", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_jI9hqa-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png"}, "id": "rKXfsB", "name": "Burley Oak Craft Brewery"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.075", "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:46:27", "shortName": "BBL Aged", "id": 132, "name": "Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer"}, "createDate": "2014-06-08 12:25:09", "updateDate": "2014-06-08 12:25:10", "styleId": 132, "availableId": 2, "id": "nNzdao", "name": "Bully Guppy"}]
