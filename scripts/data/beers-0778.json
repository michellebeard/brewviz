It\u2019s that sort of place.\r\n\r\nWe brew beer for times like these, beers that the locals, and the growing number of craft beer drinkers around the country, and of course ourselves, would find simply good to drink.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot to love about Byron Bay \u2026 the beaches \u2026 the music \u2026 the people \u2026 the pubs. These are just a few of the reasons why we brew and bottle our beer in one of the greatest places on earth. This little town in Northern New South Wales has influenced everything we do at Stone & Wood.\r\n\r\nNot only has it helped shape our philosophy of trying to take things slowly and keeping it simple, but the natural beauty, on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, and the laid back vibe were the inspiration for our beers.\r\n\r\n\u2018Byron\u2019 is a destination for visitors from around the world and we\u2019re always grateful we get to call the place home.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-02-07 05:22:22", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "kloFvq", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Byron Bay", "createDate": "2014-02-08 16:03:09", "streetAddress": "4 Boronia Place", "postalCode": "2481", "website": "http://www.stoneandwood.com.au", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2008", "countryIsoCode": "AU", "phone": "+61 2 6685 5173", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": -28.6344333, "locationType": "micro", "region": "New South Wales", "longitude": 153.585656, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "Australia", "name": "AUSTRALIA", "isoThree": "AUS", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 36, "isoCode": "AU"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Stone & Wood", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:51:00", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/buuCTR/upload_eHfE6w-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/buuCTR/upload_eHfE6w-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/buuCTR/upload_eHfE6w-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/buuCTR/upload_eHfE6w-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/buuCTR/upload_eHfE6w-icon.png"}, "id": "buuCTR", "name": "Stone & Wood"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.045", "description": "Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.
