When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Fridays 3pm - 7pm", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Centralia", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:52", "id": "TkT8Rc", "streetAddress": "5945 Prather Road", "postalCode": "98531", "website": "http://dicksbeer.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1984", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-586-7760", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 46.771347, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Washington", "longitude": -123.007543, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Dick's", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:44:31", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_tiILgV-icon.png"}, "id": "GC3a1f", "name": "Dick's Brewing Company"}], "name": "Barley Wine Ale", "nameDisplay": "Barley Wine Ale", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/3jruX6/upload_VZeg0s-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/3jruX6/upload_VZeg0s-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/3jruX6/upload_VZeg0s-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.09", "description": "American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2016-05-07 17:45:28", "locations": [{"website": "http://brewage.at/", "inPlanning": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "1060 Wien", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "createDate": "2016-05-07 17:50:12", "countryIsoCode": "AT", "longitude": 16.3434939, "hoursOfOperation": "Tue:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nWed:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nThu:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n", "isClosed": "N", "phone": "+43 1 9550935", "streetAddress": "Mittelgasse 4", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-05-07 17:50:12", "country": {"displayName": "Austria", "name": "AUSTRIA", "isoThree": "AUT", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 40, "isoCode": "AT"}, "latitude": 48.1939642, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "mMnrjZ", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Brew Age", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-05-07 18:30:52", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Y2gEyS/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png"}, "id": "Y2gEyS", "name": "Brew Age"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 1, "name": "British Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.085", "description": "British-style barley wines range from tawny copper to dark brown in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

From their travels to the southern and eastern reaches of their Empire, the Romans knew of them, and oranges are occasionally depicted in Roman art.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is generally accepted that citrus fruits were first cultivated in Sicily during the Arab period, in the ninth and tenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThe modern English word orange, like the Italian arancia, probably derives from the Arabic naranj. Oranges are native to tropical Asia, particularly the Malay region.\r\n\r\nCultivation of oranges gradually spread through China and India to east Africa and then to the Mediterranean region. The trees enjoy a mild climate, sunny weather and good drainage. An occasional frost or chill does not harm them.\r\n\r\nBlood oranges are so called for their red flesh and deep red juice. When ripe, their skin may also be reddish, at least in part. In the British Empire, blood oranges were called \"Maltese\" oranges, and are closely related to Jaffa oranges. In Sicily, the most popular blood oranges are the Tarocco, the Moro and the Sanguigno, the latter cultivated extensively in the western part of the island as the Sanguinello of Patern\u00f2 and Adern\u00f2. Though consumed in salads and desserts, blood oranges are favored for their distinctive red juice which, as it happens, is exceptionally healthy, being rich in antioxidants.\r\n\r\nThe blood orange is considered particularly Sicilian, perhaps because it is not as widely cultivated in Calabria, Spain or Greece. It is worth mentioning that, as regards citrus fruits generally, Italy is one of the world's largest producers of lemons, most of which are harvested in Sicily. It was this citrus production that earned the hills and valleys around Palermo the name \"Conca d'Oro\" (golden seashell) in the Middle Ages.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "nameDisplay": "Barley's Blood Thirst Wheat", "breweries": [{"website": "http://barleysbrewing.com/", "status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Barley's Smokehouse & Brewpub", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:14", "locations": [{"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "LGwKP5", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Columbus", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:14", "streetAddress": "1130 Dublin Road", "postalCode": "43215", "website": "http://barleysbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "614-485-0227", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Ale House No. 2", "latitude": 39.973942, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -83.048991, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "UgfMbw", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Columbus", "createDate": "2015-08-14 20:11:07", "streetAddress": "467 N High St", "postalCode": "43215", "website": "http://barleysbrewing.com/index.php", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1991", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "614.228.2537", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Barley's Smokehouse & Brewpub", "latitude": 39.971915, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Ohio", "longitude": -83.002897, "updateDate": "2015-11-19 21:17:27", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Barley's Smokehouse & Brewpub", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:39:12", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p85u1P/upload_KrN40a-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p85u1P/upload_KrN40a-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p85u1P/upload_KrN40a-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p85u1P/upload_KrN40a-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/p85u1P/upload_KrN40a-icon.png"}, "id": "p85u1P", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "originalGravity": "1.048", "id": "P0kNsL", "createDate": "2015-08-14 20:35:33", "updateDate": "2015-08-14 20:35:33", "abv": "5", "styleId": 112, "availableId": 2, "foodPairings": "Bucket of mussels, Meditteranean Platter, Pierogi and Sausage; just about any dessert; this beer really can wash down anything or quench a thirst all by itself.", "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "ogMin": "1.036", "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.
