The first brewery on the \u00c5land islands was established back in the 1850's, but Stallhagen is now \u00c5land's only brewery, with a production site at Grelsby, 18 km from Mariehamn.\r\n\r\nThe initial aim of the brewery was to produce good craft beers, mainly for the \u00c5land market. However, with its flavorful products the company has quickly won innumerable friends outside \u00c5land, and Stallhagen beer is now sold in both Finland and Sweden. Steadily increasing demand and investments in higher production capacity have led to a growth in sales volumes and made the Stallhagen brand well-known to beer-lovers generally, not just the growing flock of experts and connoisseurs.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2015-09-22 21:58:03", "locations": [{"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "FI", "name": "Main Brewery", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Godby", "longitude": 19.9879698, "isClosed": "N", "latitude": 60.2299259, "streetAddress": "Getav\u00e4gen 196", "createDate": "2015-09-30 15:12:07", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-09-30 15:12:07", "country": {"displayName": "Finland", "name": "FINLAND", "isoThree": "FIN", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 246, "isoCode": "FI"}, "postalCode": "22410", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "SffK5k", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Stallhagen", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:16:46", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FrIEDm/upload_TpB4HJ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FrIEDm/upload_TpB4HJ-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FrIEDm/upload_TpB4HJ-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FrIEDm/upload_TpB4HJ-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FrIEDm/upload_TpB4HJ-icon.png"}, "id": "FrIEDm", "name": "Stallhagen"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 9, "name": "Other Lager"}, "ogMin": "1.072", "description": "A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast.

In May 2006 the Baltika #3 was produced in an innovative package: a premium 1 liter PET-package that looks practically the same as the half-liter glass bottle. In 2007 the Baltika #3 bottle received an embossed lettering. At the same time the brand was produced in a one-liter aluminum can that was new for the market. In April 2008 a 1.5-liter PET bottle with a \"football\" design was produced for the Baltika #3, especially for the Russian Football Championship. The PET-glass material has high protective qualities and keeps the most popular Russian beer fresh for a longer period.\r\n\r\nDue to the high demand the production of this popular brand keeps growing. By the results of the 2008, the volume of sales amounted +7,5% (Business Analytica) , which allows the brand to remain a certain leader in the medium-price segment. The highest distribution level of Baltika Company for food products (98%) makes the Baltika \u21163 available for buyers all over the country.\r\n\r\nToday the Classic beer is exported to over 40 countries around the world, including Germany, Japan, Great Britain, the United Arab Emirates, Greece, France, and Ireland.\r\n\r\nFor ten years running the Baltika #3 Classic has received the prestigious Russian \"Commodity of the Year\" prize in the field of consumer goods. The prize is awarded to the most popular mass consumption products available in the assortment of retail shops. Since the time the prize was established the Baltika #3 Classic has been the unconditional leader in the \"beer\" category.\r\n\r\nThis beer brand is also annually declared \"The Most People\u2019s Brand\" by the results of tasting at the Moscow Beer Festival, the largest beer festival in Russia. In 2008 the Baltika #3 won a silver medal at the Superior Taste Award contest in Brussels established by the International Taste and Quality Institute.
