Roast barley character blends with hints of chocolate and espresso. The beer finishes crisp and dry accentuated by a nice hop character. At 4.8% ABV, this is a great session beer for your St. Patty's Day celebration.\r\n\r\nWe like to serve our Small Stout \"Nitro\" style. This involves using a blend of Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide gas and pouring the beer through a specially designed \"Stout Tap.\" We also use Nitrogen gas to condition the beer. Beer served in this way presents a beautiful cascading bubble effect and a dense, white head as it is poured.
