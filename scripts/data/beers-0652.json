Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "ibuMin": "12", "categoryId": 1, "srmMax": "19", "ibuMax": "20", "abvMin": "3.5", "fgMin": "1.01", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:19:48", "fgMax": "1.014", "shortName": "Scottish Heavy", "abvMax": "4", "id": 8, "srmMin": "10", "name": "Scottish-Style Heavy Ale"}, "glass": {"createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "id": 5, "name": "Pint"}, "createDate": "2012-02-17 17:20:43", "updateDate": "2015-12-16 15:53:03", "abv": "7", "styleId": 8, "availableId": 4, "id": "mn2Xz5", "glasswareId": 5}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.rocketrepublicbrewing.com/", "established": "2013", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "We are located in Madison, Alabama!", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2013-06-08 13:24:11", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "mY1LX6", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "Y", "locality": "Madison", "createDate": "2013-06-08 13:24:40", "streetAddress": "500 Lanier Road", "postalCode": "35758", "website": "http://www.rocketrepublicbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2013", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(256) 555-1212", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 34.6858945, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Alabama", "longitude": -86.7382118, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Rocket Republic", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2016-06-23 18:48:23", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hxuK21/upload_kdJyYc-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hxuK21/upload_kdJyYc-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hxuK21/upload_kdJyYc-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hxuK21/upload_kdJyYc-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hxuK21/upload_kdJyYc-icon.png"}, "id": "hxuK21", "name": "Rocket Republic Brewing Company"}], "description": "Mach 1 IPA- Our interpretation of an India Pale Ale comes fully loaded in all American style with its sweet tangerine aroma and tangy citrus flavor.
