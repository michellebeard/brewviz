Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body.

He has traveled as far as Wisconsin to obtain equipment for his two barrel brewhouse. He is excited to finally put down the hammer and dedicate his full attention to commercially brewing his fine-tuned recipes. Bill, who firmly believes a local, family business offers the best service and product, is proud to have a family-run business operated by only him and his girlfriend. His product is hand-bottled and labeled. As of now, the beer is available in Franklin County, MA, with a wider distribution area in the future.
