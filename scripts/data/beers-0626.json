Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 3, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:28:32", "shortName": "Sour", "id": 40, "name": "American-Style Sour Ale"}, "createDate": "2015-09-26 23:07:06", "updateDate": "2015-09-26 23:07:06", "abv": "6.6", "styleId": 40, "id": "7sF2Sh", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Lervig / Redchurch Softly Softly (Cognac Barrel Aged)", "nameDisplay": "Lervig / Redchurch Softly Softly (Cognac Barrel Aged)", "breweries": [{"website": "http://lervig.no", "established": "2003", "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Lervig Aktiebryggeri", "createDate": "2015-05-01 16:11:10", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "x67fDE", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "STAVANGER", "createDate": "2015-05-01 16:12:39", "streetAddress": "Vierveien 1", "postalCode": "4016", "extendedAddress": "Hillev\u00e5g", "website": "http://lervig.no", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "NO", "phone": "51 81 25 00", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Lervig Aktiebryggeri", "latitude": 58.9454198, "locationType": "micro", "longitude": 5.7414499, "updateDate": "2015-05-18 16:48:47", "country": {"displayName": "Norway", "name": "NORWAY", "isoThree": "NOR", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 578, "isoCode": "NO"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Lervig Aktiebryggeri", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 16:08:21", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YbGyBr/upload_G7PPsf-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YbGyBr/upload_G7PPsf-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YbGyBr/upload_G7PPsf-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YbGyBr/upload_G7PPsf-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YbGyBr/upload_G7PPsf-icon.png"}, "id": "YbGyBr", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness.

While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "100", "ibuMax": "100", "abvMin": "2.5", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:44:53", "fgMax": "1.03", "shortName": "Specialty", "abvMax": "25", "id": 125, "srmMin": "1", "name": "Specialty Beer"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:36", "updateDate": "2015-05-15 18:23:50", "abv": "10", "styleId": 125, "id": "BqjVRW", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/", "established": "1986", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because\u2014like today\u2014we loved beer and wanted more quality choices.  \r\n\r\nThere was only one problem: we were beer lovers, not brewers.

We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:57", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "AGRvvY", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Windsor", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:57", "streetAddress": "336 Ruth Carney Drive", "postalCode": "05089", "website": "http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "802-674-5491", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 43.5130201, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Vermont", "longitude": -72.4016913, "updateDate": "2014-10-06 15:45:55", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "9aSjFg", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Boston", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "306 Northern Avenue", "postalCode": "02210", "website": "http://www.harpoonbrewery.com", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1986", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-888-HARPOON", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Boston", "latitude": 42.3465, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Massachusetts", "longitude": -71.033843, "updateDate": "2014-09-26 14:01:43", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Harpoon", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:47:47", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_AbOUmA-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_AbOUmA-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_AbOUmA-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_AbOUmA-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_AbOUmA-icon.png"}, "id": "RzvedX", "name": "Harpoon Brewery"}], "ibu": "45", "servingTemperature": "cool", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 14:30:35", "createDate": "2014-06-16 18:49:35"}]
