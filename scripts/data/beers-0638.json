Our brewpub in Logan Square is a bustling, neighborhood institution where friends and families meet to enjoy the freshest beer in town. Opening our brewery has been a labor of love. We think you can see that in everything we do ranging from the details of our carved fists holding up our mahogany bar to the pungent hop aroma of our Anti-Hero IPA to our creative dishes like our bacon-fat popcorn.\r\n\r\nThe growth of craft breweries in the U.S. has been nothing short of a revolution and we're proud to be standing tall in this new crowd. The changing tastes of beer drinkers demand bigger flavors and more variety. That's exactly what we give you at Revolution Brewing. Our brewpub produces about 50 different beer styles each year. We've got session beers like Workingman Mild, hop-bombs like Double Fist and more bourbon barrel aged beers than you can shake a stave at. We have fun doing what we do and invite you to come in and join us.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon-Fri: 11am-2am\r\nSat: 10am-3am\r\nSun: 10am-2am", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:07", "id": "xjjDoA", "streetAddress": "2323 N Milwaukee Ave", "postalCode": "60647", "website": "http://revbrew.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "773-227-2739", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Brewpub", "latitude": 41.923363, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.698071, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"inPlanning": "N", "countryIsoCode": "US", "name": "Main Brewery", "locality": "Chicago", "openToPublic": "Y", "locationType": "micro", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.707668, "isClosed": "N", "phone": "773-588-2267", "streetAddress": "3340 N Kedzie Ave", "createDate": "2012-08-10 17:02:16", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}, "postalCode": "60618", "latitude": 41.941773, "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "6gM8vr", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}], "nameShortDisplay": "Revolution", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:55:57", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PHkaP0/upload_X9hrAl-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PHkaP0/upload_X9hrAl-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PHkaP0/upload_X9hrAl-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PHkaP0/upload_X9hrAl-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PHkaP0/upload_X9hrAl-icon.png"}, "id": "PHkaP0", "name": "Revolution Brewing"}], "name": "Local Hero", "nameDisplay": "Local Hero", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cYEwA6/upload_CL6GVk-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cYEwA6/upload_CL6GVk-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/cYEwA6/upload_CL6GVk-icon.png"}, "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

At least one regional combination of ingredients and/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:45:15", "shortName": "Indigenous Beer", "id": 128, "name": "Indigenous Beer (Lager or Ale)"}, "createDate": "2014-09-19 18:41:36", "updateDate": "2015-02-13 16:38:12", "abv": "6", "styleId": 128, "id": "h2NYmE", "name": "Local Honey"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Available at the same time of year, every year.", "id": 4, "name": "Seasonal"}, "isOrganic": "N", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.prairiesun.ca/", "established": "2013", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Cameron and Heather were approached by a clever entrepreneur that saw the opportunity for craft beer growth in Saskatchewan, to run his brewery for him.

There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "ibuMin": "20", "categoryId": 5, "srmMax": "14", "ibuMax": "40", "abvMin": "4.5", "fgMin": "1.004", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:34:55", "fgMax": "1.016", "shortName": "Saison", "abvMax": "8.5", "id": 72, "srmMin": "4", "name": "French & Belgian-Style Saison"}, "createDate": "2015-12-14 13:30:02", "updateDate": "2015-12-14 13:30:02", "styleId": 72, "id": "6vnH4i", "name": "Local Influence Series"}, {"status": "verified", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "Local INK is a rich, smooth, malty ale with depth and complexity from a carefully selected combination of truly local malts.
