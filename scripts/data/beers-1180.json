Who knew that brewing delicious beer was so similar to the science of treating water? The process of releasing enzymes to break down starches into sugar and fermenting the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide is second nature to a water engineer, while balancing delicious flavor is what a gourmet cook strives for. Hence the \u201cblueprint\u201d for great beer was born! Eric\u2019s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint.\r\n\r\nBetter than a recipe, a brewing \u201cblueprint\u201d combines science and great culinary skill to create a Br\u00fceprint.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery\u2014Br\u00fceprint Brewing Company.

But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We\u2019re not afraid to try new things.\r\n\r\nAs a brewer, its playtime and work, balanced.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:54", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "hoursOfOperation": "Mon:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\nTue:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Fort Collins", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:54", "id": "YKa9wh", "streetAddress": "133 Remington Street", "postalCode": "80524", "website": "http://www.equinoxbrewing.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "2010", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "970-430-6489", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 40.586331, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Colorado", "longitude": -105.0757067, "updateDate": "2014-12-03 19:58:04", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Equinox", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:07:44", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_iB5vAJ-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_iB5vAJ-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_iB5vAJ-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_iB5vAJ-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_iB5vAJ-icon.png"}, "id": "wYyIFx", "name": "Equinox Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.06", "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars.
