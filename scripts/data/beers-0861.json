The distinctive smoked character, courtesy of wood-fire kilned malts in the recipe, is balanced by rich, malty sweetness. Our friend Thomas at Weyermann Malts in Bamberg, Germany custom-designed the malt profile for this recipe (over breakfast no less!), and we brewed it in tribute to our close ties with them.\r\nHISTORY & STYLE\r\n\r\nRauchbier is a beer style originating in the region of Franconia in Germany. The unique feature of this style is that the malt has been kilned over wood fire (typically beechwood). As a result of this process the malt imparts a pungent smoky character to the beer.\r\n\r\nTASTING NOTES\r\n\r\nThe first impression of Rauchstack is undoubtedly its rich, smoky aroma. The body is luscious and the flavour echoes the smoky scent, giving the sense of a beer that could almost be a meal. The smoke is balanced by malty sweetness.

It didn't take long before the act, the ideas, and the processes of brewing began to take over our lives. Shortly thereafter we dubbed ourselves Black Pond Brews, after a pond where we had some fun and memorable times in Woodstock, CT. Within no time we were entering our beers into homebrew competitions and they were met with immediate success. Spurred by this success and by the constant clamoring of our friends and family to make more beer, we really began to ask ourselves: how do we turn this passion for producing beer into a commercial reality?\r\n \r\nOur project is not only valuable to us, but to the community in which we will operate.  Our beautiful, quiet town of Danielson, CT will become a destination for anyone who loves beer, be they local or travellers.  Who doesn't love beer?  Further, who doesn't love MORE beer to try?!\r\n \r\nWhat inspires us?\r\nThe ability to write or create something unique, something revolutionary. Clara Barton once said \u201cI defy the tyranny of precedent. I go for anything new that might improve the past\". Such a philosophy is inherent in the way we approach brewing. Breweries often spend much of their time and effort looking back to past recipes- often times as far back as the inception of brewing itself- but what of the future? What new ideas and flavors can we explore?
