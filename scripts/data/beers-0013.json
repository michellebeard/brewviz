While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage \u2014 an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2014-04-08 13:11:43", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "Zhydrx", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Vista", "createDate": "2014-04-08 13:13:42", "streetAddress": "2545 Progress Street", "postalCode": "92081", "extendedAddress": "Suite D", "website": "http://boozebrothersbrewery.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "(760) 295-0217", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 33.148172, "locationType": "micro", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.218047, "updateDate": "2015-08-26 16:23:19", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Booze Brothers", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 15:53:28", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xaBLno/upload_Ca9D8k-icon.png"}, "id": "xaBLno", "name": "Booze Brothers Brewing Co."}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "id": 11, "name": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"}, "description": "A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style.

The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "locations": [{"status": "deleted", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "bcXmR6", "locationTypeDisplay": "Micro Brewery", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Williamsport", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:45", "streetAddress": "429 W. 3rd St", "postalCode": "17701", "website": "http://www.bavarianbarbarian.com", "statusDisplay": "Deleted", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "570.332.5050", "isClosed": "Y", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.238187, "locationType": "micro", "region": "Pennsylvania", "longitude": -77.009056, "updateDate": "2015-10-19 17:21:47", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Bavarian Barbarian", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:39:18", "id": "lfsNEt", "name": "Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company"}], "style": {"category": {"createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:45", "id": 3, "name": "North American Origin Ales"}, "ogMin": "1.075", "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.
