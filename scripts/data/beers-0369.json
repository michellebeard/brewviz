From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "DrFlD0", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Carlsbad", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "571 Carlsbad Village Dr.", "postalCode": "92008", "website": "http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/carlsbad/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1997", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "760-720-7007", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Carlsbad", "latitude": 33.1596505, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "California", "longitude": -117.3478111, "updateDate": "2014-07-23 19:11:34", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "hoursOfOperation": "Sun - Thur - 11am - 10pm\r\nFri - Sat. - 11am - Midnight", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Solana Beach", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "id": "qAyZMR", "streetAddress": "135 N.

We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival.

In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "locations": [{"status": "verified", "openToPublic": "N", "isPrimary": "Y", "id": "S2n5TB", "locationTypeDisplay": "Production Facility", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:56", "streetAddress": "1800 West Fulton Street", "postalCode": "60612", "website": "http://www.gooseisland.com/", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1995", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "1-800-466-7363", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Main Brewery", "latitude": 41.887107, "locationType": "production", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.6720969, "updateDate": "2014-09-11 10:33:51", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}, {"openToPublic": "Y", "isPrimary": "N", "id": "D2gG2C", "locationTypeDisplay": "Brewpub", "inPlanning": "N", "locality": "Chicago", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:42:15", "streetAddress": "1800 North Clybourn Avenue", "postalCode": "60614", "status": "verified", "statusDisplay": "Verified", "yearOpened": "1988", "countryIsoCode": "US", "phone": "800-466-7363", "isClosed": "N", "name": "Clybourn", "latitude": 41.9137242, "locationType": "brewpub", "region": "Illinois", "longitude": -87.65373, "updateDate": "2014-09-11 10:32:55", "country": {"displayName": "United States", "name": "UNITED STATES", "isoThree": "USA", "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:41:33", "numberCode": 840, "isoCode": "US"}}], "nameShortDisplay": "Goose Island", "status": "verified", "updateDate": "2015-12-22 14:46:51", "images": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png", "squareMedium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png", "squareLarge": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png"}, "id": "APW1BC", "name": "Goose Island Beer Company"}], "name": "Eva", "nameDisplay": "Eva", "labels": {"large": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/lG6C3T/upload_uiCn0p-large.png", "medium": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/lG6C3T/upload_uiCn0p-medium.png", "icon": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/lG6C3T/upload_uiCn0p-icon.png"}, "createDate": "2012-01-03 02:43:11", "updateDate": "2015-06-04 17:26:24", "id": "lG6C3T", "statusDisplay": "Verified"}]
