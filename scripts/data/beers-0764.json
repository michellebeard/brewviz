Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro.

Eug\u00e8ne de Ro brewed his first top-fermented beer in 1898. 4 years later he was also brewing bottom-fermented beers. In 1929 the dairy closed, so the brewery was able to expand production into other types of beers: Bock, Export, Pilsner and Stout Ale. In 1950 they established their first bottling plant. Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall.

Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.", "createDate": "2012-03-21 20:06:46", "categoryId": 11, "srmMax": "100", "ibuMax": "100", "abvMin": "2.5", "fgMin": "1.006", "updateDate": "2015-04-07 15:44:53", "fgMax": "1.03", "shortName": "Specialty", "abvMax": "25", "id": 125, "srmMin": "1", "name": "Specialty Beer"}, "createDate": "2013-12-11 12:51:51", "updateDate": "2015-12-17 07:57:39", "abv": "7.4", "styleId": 125, "availableId": 2, "id": "6NF7EX", "name": "Once In a Lifetime"}, {"status": "verified", "available": {"description": "Limited availability.", "id": 2, "name": "Limited"}, "isOrganic": "N", "name": "Once Upon A Time 1855 East India Porter", "nameDisplay": "Once Upon A Time 1855 East India Porter", "breweries": [{"website": "http://www.prettythingsbeertoday.com/", "established": "2008", "isOrganic": "N", "description": "We are a gypsy brewery, without a permanent brewing home.
