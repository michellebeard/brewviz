While visiting relatives in Bavaria, Germany and having traveled numerous times to the great brewing countries of the UK and Europe, Mark came to this simple conclusion, \u201cAmerican beers are boring and just are not very satisfying\u201d. In Europe and the UK every area had its own local brewery and the beer was fresh and had flavor and a lot of body. So his quest to bring premium fresh flavorful beers to his town was born.\r\n\r\nWorking as an apprentice with some of the original craft brewers in California, it gave him an a working knowledge and appreciation as well as insight into the business of craft beer. Heritage Brewing was co-founded by Mark in 1989 and was Orange County\u2019s first micro brewery (brewpub) and they also became known as the premier live blues venue in the OC. Several years later Mark founded his production facility in Riverside County and produced products under Heritage\u2019s label as well as producing white label products for restaurants such as Claim Jumper, Wahoo\u2019s, BJ\u2019s Pizza, etc. In addition, Mark's facility produced and packaged many bottled products that have sold in all major retailers throughout So Cal.\r\n\r\nMark has brewed on various systems from 7bbl to 110 bbl, as well as installations and recipe formulations for many local brewpubs. Mark has received numerous awards from local beer festivals, state fairs, national and international beer festivals. Having received over 20 awards ranging from best of show, blue ribbons, bronze, silver and gold, with a Gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival, you can rest assured that the philosophy surrounding Mark, is a quality product every time.
